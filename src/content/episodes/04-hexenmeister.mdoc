Not far from the location of the Woodstock festival, a gruesome murder took place in Kenoza Lake, New York in 1892. The odd death of George Markert, an inoffensive German farmer, devastated the hamlet and news of the bizarre details were sensationalized by The New York Times. The tale you find at the site of the murder *and* the tales you find when you search online get the story wrong.

Who killed George Markert and why did they do it? Listen to tonight's episode to hear the true tale. Frank spent an inordinate amount of time combing over the local newspaper, the Sullivan County Record, to piece together a more accurate timeline of events on that cold January night over 130 years ago. Will it be spooky? Maybe... At the very least, it is setting the record straight.
