Mysterious apparitions are said to haunt the Country House Restaurant in Stony Brook, New York. The building's 300 year history predates the founding of America. Owners throughout the years conducted seances and other rituals, potentially inviting dark forces to make their home on the grounds. Owners, workers, and patrons of the restaurant have reported ghostly phenomena ranging from poltergeist activity of wine bottles and glasses flying across rooms, to dark visions of local 19th century artist and Spiritualist William Sidney Mount.

But the most infamous story of the colonial era house is that of Annette Williamson and her family. Poor Annette is said to have been killed in cold blood by an angry town mob after appearing to have supported the British during the Revolutionary War. Many claim to have seen the ghost of Annette haunting the Country House Restaurant in the years since her untimely demise. Her tragic tale was first related to the building's owner decades ago by a visiting French psychic, evidently given to him directly by Annette herself. It's been verified and promulgated by Long Island's famous psychic/medium duo Kerriann Brosky and Joe Giaquinto, who claim to have contacted Annette on the property and have published books and reports on their experiences there. It's easy to find stories of workers catching glimpses of her silhouette in windows, hearing her footsteps, or even catching a full body apparition of the poor young 17 year old girl whose distress and dismay overwhelms whoever encounters her. Many paranormal investigations over the years have purported to find evidence of her spirit and many others haunting the property.

But when you take a moment to peek behind the veil and start to dig deeper into the story, not everything is as it seems. How historical is the tragic story of Annete Williamson? Potentially more interesting... If the story isn't entirely true, *who* is the spirit that haunts the Country House Restaurant?
