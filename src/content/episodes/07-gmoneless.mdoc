*No, that's not a typo in the title! You'll have to listen to the very end of this episode to understand.*

Cultures across the whole world and through all of recorded history have passed down legends of Little People. Not humans with dwarfism, but mystical races of tiny human-like creatures typically ranging from 1 to 3 feet in height. Ireland, Greece, the Philippines, the Hawaiian Islands, New Zealand, Flores Island, Indonesia, the Americas, and more have their own variations on the legends.

The indigenous peoples of the Americas were no exception, and today we explore their legends in the American northeast. We hear the story of young Dirty Clothes (mixtape dropping soon), from the Mahican tribe in modern-day Connecticut, the legend of Henry Hudson encountering gnomes in the Catskills, and then dive into a handpicked selection of crazy modern encounters in the area from the book Little People by Ron Quinn.

We finish with insane quotes from people online seeking help with their gnome issues in their daily lives.
