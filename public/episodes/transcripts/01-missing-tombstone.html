<time>00:00:14</time>
<p>Tonight on our very</p>
<time>00:00:21</time>
<p>first episode, we&#x27;re talking</p>
<time>00:00:22</time>
<p>about one of Long Island New</p>
<time>00:00:24</time>
<p>York&#x27;s most haunted places with</p>
<time>00:00:26</time>
<p>over three centuries of history,</p>
<time>00:00:28</time>
<p>the Country House Restaurant in</p>
<time>00:00:30</time>
<p>Stony Brook. We&#x27;ll hear the sad</p>
<time>00:00:32</time>
<p>story of Annette Williamson&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:00:33</time>
<p>death and search the Obadiah</p>
<time>00:00:35</time>
<p>Davis Cemetery to find out who</p>
<time>00:00:36</time>
<p>really has been haunting the</p>
<time>00:00:38</time>
<p>property and spooking owners,</p>
<time>00:00:39</time>
<p>workers, and patrons alike over</p>
<time>00:00:41</time>
<p>the years, and along the way</p>
<time>00:00:42</time>
<p>we&#x27;ll learn to never trust</p>
<time>00:00:44</time>
<p>French psychics. It&#x27;s Wednesday</p>
<time>00:00:46</time>
<p>at 9pm. Okay guys, I have a</p>
<time>00:01:01</time>
<p>great story to start the show</p>
<time>00:01:03</time>
<p>off. Over the weekend, I was</p>
<time>00:01:06</time>
<p>visiting family for my grandma&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:01:07</time>
<p>birthday and my Uncle Joe from</p>
<time>00:01:09</time>
<p>Long Island mentioned that</p>
<time>00:01:11</time>
<p>there&#x27;s a billion haunted places</p>
<time>00:01:13</time>
<p>on Long Island. We love Uncle</p>
<time>00:01:15</time>
<p>Joe. We do. He&#x27;s great, but he</p>
<time>00:01:17</time>
<p>pointed me in the direction of</p>
<time>00:01:17</time>
<p>some stories what&#x27;s considered</p>
<time>00:01:19</time>
<p>the most haunted location on</p>
<time>00:01:21</time>
<p>Long Island. It&#x27;s called the</p>
<time>00:01:23</time>
<p>Country House Restaurant and I</p>
<time>00:01:24</time>
<p>want to tell you guys a story</p>
<time>00:01:26</time>
<p>about the ghosts that haunted</p>
<time>00:01:27</time>
<p>and why the story that&#x27;s told</p>
<time>00:01:29</time>
<p>might not be true. Oh,</p>
<time>00:01:31</time>
<p>scandalous. Yeah, I like stories</p>
<time>00:01:33</time>
<p>with different perspectives.</p>
<time>00:01:35</time>
<p>Yeah, I bet you do. Okay, so</p>
<time>00:01:42</time>
<p>actually we might have passed by</p>
<time>00:01:44</time>
<p>this actually when we went on</p>
<time>00:01:45</time>
<p>our trip to Long Island over the</p>
<time>00:01:47</time>
<p>summer. It&#x27;s in Stony Brook. We</p>
<time>00:01:49</time>
<p>were in Lake the Hamptons. Sauer</p>
<time>00:01:51</time>
<p>is pretty far out east way past</p>
<time>00:01:52</time>
<p>this, but we might have driven</p>
<time>00:01:54</time>
<p>right past this road, right past</p>
<time>00:01:55</time>
<p>this restaurant. For those who</p>
<time>00:01:58</time>
<p>don&#x27;t know Long Island, it&#x27;s on</p>
<time>00:01:59</time>
<p>the north shore of Long Island,</p>
<time>00:02:01</time>
<p>which is the huge island to the</p>
<time>00:02:03</time>
<p>east of New York City. It&#x27;s not</p>
<time>00:02:05</time>
<p>part of New York City, but two</p>
<time>00:02:08</time>
<p>boroughs of New York City,</p>
<time>00:02:10</time>
<p>Brooklyn and Queens, are on the</p>
<time>00:02:12</time>
<p>island, but they don&#x27;t really</p>
<time>00:02:13</time>
<p>consider it Long Island. People</p>
<time>00:02:14</time>
<p>would be very offended if you</p>
<time>00:02:15</time>
<p>said you were from Long Island</p>
<time>00:02:17</time>
<p>if you&#x27;re from Queens or</p>
<time>00:02:18</time>
<p>Brooklyn. So do you guys know</p>
<time>00:02:19</time>
<p>how old European settlements on</p>
<time>00:02:21</time>
<p>Long Island are? If you had to</p>
<time>00:02:23</time>
<p>give a random guess? Well, 400</p>
<time>00:02:26</time>
<p>years. Okay, I thought you guys</p>
<time>00:02:29</time>
<p>can be wrong. That&#x27;s right. It&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:02:30</time>
<p>like 300 years old since the 16,</p>
<time>00:02:33</time>
<p>that&#x27;s almost 400, honestly,</p>
<time>00:02:35</time>
<p>1600s, mid 1600s. Right. The</p>
<time>00:02:38</time>
<p>water above it, the Long Island</p>
<time>00:02:40</time>
<p>Sound is where everyone would do</p>
<time>00:02:41</time>
<p>like whaling, killing whales and</p>
<time>00:02:43</time>
<p>taking their meat and selling</p>
<time>00:02:45</time>
<p>them whatever. It was like</p>
<time>00:02:46</time>
<p>really nice water for that. So</p>
<time>00:02:48</time>
<p>it became really popular early</p>
<time>00:02:49</time>
<p>1600s. So a lot of the buildings</p>
<time>00:02:50</time>
<p>there are hundreds of hundreds</p>
<time>00:02:53</time>
<p>of years old. The building we&#x27;re</p>
<time>00:02:54</time>
<p>talking about today was built in</p>
<time>00:02:57</time>
<p>1710. Oh, yeah. So pre-America.</p>
<time>00:03:02</time>
<p>Yeah, pre-America, basically</p>
<time>00:03:03</time>
<p>what happened, a lot of New</p>
<time>00:03:04</time>
<p>England settlers came down to</p>
<time>00:03:07</time>
<p>Long Island mid 1600s for the</p>
<time>00:03:10</time>
<p>farming and for the whaling.</p>
<time>00:03:12</time>
<p>This is like prime time for a</p>
<time>00:03:14</time>
<p>few different things,</p>
<time>00:03:15</time>
<p>Freemasonry, secret societies,</p>
<time>00:03:19</time>
<p>and a little bit later on,</p>
<time>00:03:21</time>
<p>spiritualism. So I think Nick</p>
<time>00:03:23</time>
<p>and I really know about</p>
<time>00:03:24</time>
<p>spiritualism. Aaron, what do you</p>
<time>00:03:25</time>
<p>know about spiritualism? I&#x27;ll be</p>
<time>00:03:27</time>
<p>honest, not that much. That&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:03:30</time>
<p>really the idea simply that you</p>
<time>00:03:31</time>
<p>can talk to the dead. Oh, okay.</p>
<time>00:03:33</time>
<p>That&#x27;s where mediums, the idea</p>
<time>00:03:34</time>
<p>of mediumship started. Sances</p>
<time>00:03:36</time>
<p>and all kinds of things like</p>
<time>00:03:38</time>
<p>that. In America, at least, it</p>
<time>00:03:41</time>
<p>started sweeping the nation in</p>
<time>00:03:43</time>
<p>like late 1700s and mid, all the</p>
<time>00:03:47</time>
<p>way through the 1800s. And it</p>
<time>00:03:48</time>
<p>became really popular for people</p>
<time>00:03:50</time>
<p>to do s√©ances and just shut the</p>
<time>00:03:54</time>
<p>lights off and use Ouija boards</p>
<time>00:03:55</time>
<p>and the precursors to Ouija</p>
<time>00:03:57</time>
<p>boards and do table tipping and</p>
<time>00:03:59</time>
<p>all that. And mediums started</p>
<time>00:04:01</time>
<p>appearing claiming that they</p>
<time>00:04:02</time>
<p>could talk to the dead and you</p>
<time>00:04:03</time>
<p>can pay them and they&#x27;ll talk to</p>
<time>00:04:04</time>
<p>your grandma and they&#x27;ll</p>
<time>00:04:07</time>
<p>manifest your dog that died and</p>
<time>00:04:10</time>
<p>it&#x27;ll lick your face in the dark</p>
<time>00:04:11</time>
<p>and stuff like that. It was kind</p>
<time>00:04:12</time>
<p>of like parlor games more to an</p>
<time>00:04:14</time>
<p>extent. It&#x27;s a form of</p>
<time>00:04:17</time>
<p>entertainment more than</p>
<time>00:04:18</time>
<p>anything. Yeah. And</p>
<time>00:04:20</time>
<p>interestingly, this all really</p>
<time>00:04:21</time>
<p>started in like upstate New</p>
<time>00:04:23</time>
<p>York, not too far from where we</p>
<time>00:04:24</time>
<p>are right now in Heidsville,</p>
<time>00:04:26</time>
<p>which is like in between</p>
<time>00:04:29</time>
<p>Syracuse and Rochester. Oh, it&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:04:34</time>
<p>more western than central. Yeah,</p>
<time>00:04:36</time>
<p>it&#x27;s actually really west. Yeah.</p>
<time>00:04:38</time>
<p>Yeah. So this building built</p>
<time>00:04:40</time>
<p>around 1710 by the Davis family</p>
<time>00:04:43</time>
<p>and they owned it at least four</p>
<time>00:04:45</time>
<p>generations, pretty long time.</p>
<time>00:04:47</time>
<p>And again, this is on the North</p>
<time>00:04:48</time>
<p>Shore of Long Island, pretty</p>
<time>00:04:49</time>
<p>good farmland, but Stony Brook</p>
<time>00:04:51</time>
<p>really wasn&#x27;t a well-known</p>
<time>00:04:52</time>
<p>place. It was kind of like</p>
<time>00:04:53</time>
<p>backwater town for the first</p>
<time>00:04:55</time>
<p>good chunk of it because no one</p>
<time>00:04:57</time>
<p>really wanted to go there. It</p>
<time>00:04:58</time>
<p>was difficult to travel there. A</p>
<time>00:04:59</time>
<p>bunch of poor farmers. No one</p>
<time>00:05:01</time>
<p>really cared. This building, the</p>
<time>00:05:02</time>
<p>Davis family must have been</p>
<time>00:05:03</time>
<p>pretty rich because it was huge,</p>
<time>00:05:05</time>
<p>very large building, two stories</p>
<time>00:05:06</time>
<p>and pretty active throughout the</p>
<time>00:05:09</time>
<p>1700s. It housed British</p>
<time>00:05:10</time>
<p>soldiers at some point. It was</p>
<time>00:05:12</time>
<p>used as a town meeting place, as</p>
<time>00:05:14</time>
<p>a stagecoach stop. During the</p>
<time>00:05:16</time>
<p>Revolutionary War, it was used</p>
<time>00:05:16</time>
<p>as a contact point for the</p>
<time>00:05:19</time>
<p>Culper Spy Ring, which was an</p>
<time>00:05:22</time>
<p>American spy ring that George</p>
<time>00:05:24</time>
<p>Washington started. There would</p>
<time>00:05:27</time>
<p>be spies that came in and out.</p>
<time>00:05:30</time>
<p>So imagine there&#x27;s this</p>
<time>00:05:30</time>
<p>beautiful, and if you guys want</p>
<time>00:05:31</time>
<p>to click the link I sent you in</p>
<time>00:05:33</time>
<p>the Discord, which will be in</p>
<time>00:05:34</time>
<p>the show notes, you could see</p>
<time>00:05:35</time>
<p>this building. It&#x27;s a restaurant</p>
<time>00:05:36</time>
<p>now. It was only a restaurant</p>
<time>00:05:38</time>
<p>starting in like 1970, 1980.</p>
<time>00:05:42</time>
<p>That&#x27;s fairly recent for me</p>
<time>00:05:44</time>
<p>being, was it just a historical?</p>
<time>00:05:46</time>
<p>Oh, yeah, it was purchased</p>
<time>00:05:47</time>
<p>historical building for all that</p>
<time>00:05:48</time>
<p>time. Passed down through a few</p>
<time>00:05:49</time>
<p>different families. Yeah. And</p>
<time>00:05:51</time>
<p>it&#x27;s right off, it&#x27;s on the</p>
<time>00:05:52</time>
<p>corner of two main roads, Main</p>
<time>00:05:53</time>
<p>Street and like Route 25A, which</p>
<time>00:05:56</time>
<p>is that classic long road that</p>
<time>00:05:58</time>
<p>all Long Islanders know on the</p>
<time>00:05:59</time>
<p>North Shore. So yeah, a lot of</p>
<time>00:06:01</time>
<p>history here. Let&#x27;s talk about</p>
<time>00:06:02</time>
<p>some of the weird stuff, right?</p>
<time>00:06:03</time>
<p>Because there&#x27;s a lot here.</p>
<time>00:06:05</time>
<p>Imagine this nice house. It&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:06:07</time>
<p>kind of on the hill. The Davis</p>
<time>00:06:08</time>
<p>family, Obadiah Davis was the</p>
<time>00:06:10</time>
<p>guy who bought it, bought the</p>
<time>00:06:11</time>
<p>land and built the property. He</p>
<time>00:06:12</time>
<p>built a family cemetery right</p>
<time>00:06:14</time>
<p>behind it on a little hill</p>
<time>00:06:16</time>
<p>overlooking the building. It&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:06:17</time>
<p>where his family was buried.</p>
<time>00:06:19</time>
<p>That&#x27;s still there to that day,</p>
<time>00:06:21</time>
<p>the cemetery. Do you think the</p>
<time>00:06:22</time>
<p>cemetery being there might</p>
<time>00:06:24</time>
<p>contribute to some of the</p>
<time>00:06:26</time>
<p>happenings that you&#x27;re going to</p>
<time>00:06:27</time>
<p>discuss today? The cemetery does</p>
<time>00:06:30</time>
<p>feature very strongly in the</p>
<time>00:06:32</time>
<p>story. In fact, I found who&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:06:34</time>
<p>buried in that cemetery, because</p>
<time>00:06:36</time>
<p>there are some conflicting</p>
<time>00:06:37</time>
<p>stories about the ghosts that</p>
<time>00:06:40</time>
<p>want this place and who&#x27;s buried</p>
<time>00:06:43</time>
<p>here. I found the gravestones</p>
<time>00:06:45</time>
<p>and pictures of the gravestones</p>
<time>00:06:47</time>
<p>and some things don&#x27;t line up. I</p>
<time>00:06:52</time>
<p>couldn&#x27;t find where the cemetery</p>
<time>00:06:53</time>
<p>was actually, like physically on</p>
<time>00:06:56</time>
<p>Google maps or on maps. There&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:06:58</time>
<p>no record of it. You probably</p>
<time>00:06:58</time>
<p>want to keep it. I actually</p>
<time>00:06:59</time>
<p>called them up today. Oh, wow.</p>
<time>00:07:00</time>
<p>No, I called them up today on</p>
<time>00:07:02</time>
<p>the phone. And I said, hi guys,</p>
<time>00:07:04</time>
<p>where&#x27;s the Obadiah Davis</p>
<time>00:07:06</time>
<p>cemetery? And they told me,</p>
<time>00:07:09</time>
<p>they&#x27;re like, oh, it&#x27;s right</p>
<time>00:07:09</time>
<p>behind the stables next to the</p>
<time>00:07:12</time>
<p>parking lot. Oh, that&#x27;s more</p>
<time>00:07:14</time>
<p>open of them than I would</p>
<time>00:07:15</time>
<p>expect. Yeah, I was like, oh,</p>
<time>00:07:16</time>
<p>oh, OK. Though from what I&#x27;ve</p>
<time>00:07:18</time>
<p>heard from all the research I</p>
<time>00:07:20</time>
<p>did, you can&#x27;t just really, they</p>
<time>00:07:21</time>
<p>don&#x27;t really appreciate you just</p>
<time>00:07:22</time>
<p>walking there. It&#x27;s a very small</p>
<time>00:07:24</time>
<p>cemetery. It&#x27;s like 50 tombs,</p>
<time>00:07:26</time>
<p>basically. It&#x27;s kind of how it</p>
<time>00:07:27</time>
<p>goes from most cemeteries,</p>
<time>00:07:28</time>
<p>though, unless you have like</p>
<time>00:07:29</time>
<p>family there, you can&#x27;t just</p>
<time>00:07:30</time>
<p>wander about. Yeah, it&#x27;s not</p>
<time>00:07:32</time>
<p>like a public cemetery that</p>
<time>00:07:34</time>
<p>anyone can just to visit or even</p>
<time>00:07:37</time>
<p>be buried in. They&#x27;re all very</p>
<time>00:07:38</time>
<p>old, like all 17, 1800 deaths.</p>
<time>00:07:42</time>
<p>So, yeah, so what do people</p>
<time>00:07:43</time>
<p>think about this house? Well, in</p>
<time>00:07:44</time>
<p>the 1800s, there was a very</p>
<time>00:07:46</time>
<p>famous comedian named Thomas</p>
<time>00:07:49</time>
<p>Hathaway. He purchased the house</p>
<time>00:07:51</time>
<p>and lived there for a while and</p>
<time>00:07:53</time>
<p>he was a spiritualist. So what</p>
<time>00:07:55</time>
<p>did he do? Well, he started</p>
<time>00:07:56</time>
<p>hosting seances in this</p>
<time>00:07:58</time>
<p>building, right? For all the</p>
<time>00:08:01</time>
<p>neighborhood, all the people who</p>
<time>00:08:03</time>
<p>knew about this. It was more</p>
<time>00:08:04</time>
<p>actually a low key thing. He and</p>
<time>00:08:06</time>
<p>his close confidants would come</p>
<time>00:08:08</time>
<p>and perform seances and try to</p>
<time>00:08:10</time>
<p>do table tipping, which is</p>
<time>00:08:11</time>
<p>literally just putting your</p>
<time>00:08:12</time>
<p>hands on the table in the dark</p>
<time>00:08:13</time>
<p>and seeing if it starts tipping.</p>
<time>00:08:17</time>
<p>So it&#x27;s kind of similar to when</p>
<time>00:08:18</time>
<p>people like grab the Ouija board</p>
<time>00:08:21</time>
<p>and push the little device onto</p>
<time>00:08:25</time>
<p>the letter they want. Depends.</p>
<time>00:08:27</time>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it depends on what</p>
<time>00:08:30</time>
<p>you think with it, how much</p>
<time>00:08:31</time>
<p>spirits we actually want. I just</p>
<time>00:08:33</time>
<p>want to like shake a table</p>
<time>00:08:34</time>
<p>around and stuff. Yeah, I think</p>
<time>00:08:36</time>
<p>it&#x27;s a little silly. A lot of it</p>
<time>00:08:38</time>
<p>was revealed to be fraud at the</p>
<time>00:08:39</time>
<p>time. In fact, one of Thomas</p>
<time>00:08:43</time>
<p>Hathaway&#x27;s buddies was a guy</p>
<time>00:08:45</time>
<p>named William Sidney Mount, who</p>
<time>00:08:46</time>
<p>was a pretty famous artist of</p>
<time>00:08:48</time>
<p>the time. And this guy was like</p>
<time>00:08:51</time>
<p>hardcore freemason and a</p>
<time>00:08:53</time>
<p>hardcore spiritualist. And he</p>
<time>00:08:55</time>
<p>would come to these seances and</p>
<time>00:08:56</time>
<p>perform these seances all the</p>
<time>00:08:57</time>
<p>time. He lived across the street</p>
<time>00:08:59</time>
<p>basically in his own haunted</p>
<time>00:09:00</time>
<p>house. And this guy, William</p>
<time>00:09:05</time>
<p>Sidney Mount, is supposedly one</p>
<time>00:09:07</time>
<p>of the ghosts that still haunts</p>
<time>00:09:09</time>
<p>the country house restaurant to</p>
<time>00:09:11</time>
<p>this day. It&#x27;s said that he</p>
<time>00:09:13</time>
<p>comes back to perform seances</p>
<time>00:09:15</time>
<p>like he used to that he shows up</p>
<time>00:09:21</time>
<p>in his, it said he shows up in</p>
<time>00:09:23</time>
<p>his like his travel gear with</p>
<time>00:09:25</time>
<p>his big hat and like his long</p>
<time>00:09:27</time>
<p>jacket and stuff, the same dress</p>
<time>00:09:29</time>
<p>he would use to come to the</p>
<time>00:09:31</time>
<p>seances. He just keeps</p>
<time>00:09:33</time>
<p>contacting himself. He just</p>
<time>00:09:35</time>
<p>keeps contacting himself, I</p>
<time>00:09:36</time>
<p>guess. Yeah. It&#x27;s a very vicious</p>
<time>00:09:39</time>
<p>cycle. A lot of famous people</p>
<time>00:09:41</time>
<p>would do seances here. The other</p>
<time>00:09:42</time>
<p>guy that I found interesting was</p>
<time>00:09:44</time>
<p>P.T. Barnum of the fame,</p>
<time>00:09:47</time>
<p>obviously like entertainer fame</p>
<time>00:09:49</time>
<p>of circus fame. He was a buddy</p>
<time>00:09:51</time>
<p>of Hathaway because Hathaway</p>
<time>00:09:53</time>
<p>actually worked for him as a</p>
<time>00:09:55</time>
<p>performer. So you had lots of</p>
<time>00:09:57</time>
<p>interesting people, interesting</p>
<time>00:09:59</time>
<p>beliefs, hosting seances, trying</p>
<time>00:10:01</time>
<p>to contact the dead, often</p>
<time>00:10:03</time>
<p>trying to contact their own dead</p>
<time>00:10:04</time>
<p>loved ones, claiming to</p>
<time>00:10:06</time>
<p>experience different things,</p>
<time>00:10:08</time>
<p>claiming to see things. And that</p>
<time>00:10:10</time>
<p>was for a short time in the mid</p>
<time>00:10:12</time>
<p>to late 1800s. Many of the</p>
<time>00:10:15</time>
<p>owners of this place have had</p>
<time>00:10:17</time>
<p>some interest in the occult or</p>
<time>00:10:19</time>
<p>spirits or something really</p>
<time>00:10:21</time>
<p>anything like that. So given</p>
<time>00:10:23</time>
<p>that, nowadays a lot is said</p>
<time>00:10:26</time>
<p>about this place. The current</p>
<time>00:10:29</time>
<p>owner who purchased it in I</p>
<time>00:10:31</time>
<p>think like 2005, Bob</p>
<time>00:10:34</time>
<p>Willemstein, he used to work</p>
<time>00:10:36</time>
<p>there as a busboy like 20 years</p>
<time>00:10:39</time>
<p>before and he worked his way all</p>
<time>00:10:41</time>
<p>the way up to owner eventually,</p>
<time>00:10:42</time>
<p>which is pretty cool. Pretty</p>
<time>00:10:44</time>
<p>impressive. And there are many</p>
<time>00:10:47</time>
<p>interviews with him where he</p>
<time>00:10:50</time>
<p>tells all the stories of all the</p>
<time>00:10:51</time>
<p>crazy things that happen to him,</p>
<time>00:10:53</time>
<p>that happened to his workers,</p>
<time>00:10:56</time>
<p>that happened to visitors, that</p>
<time>00:10:57</time>
<p>happened to guests. Right?</p>
<time>00:10:59</time>
<p>Because this is a restaurant</p>
<time>00:10:59</time>
<p>that we can go to. In fact, I</p>
<time>00:11:04</time>
<p>know someone who&#x27;s gone to it.</p>
<time>00:11:05</time>
<p>My girlfriend Sarah has eaten</p>
<time>00:11:06</time>
<p>there as a kid, but supposedly</p>
<time>00:11:08</time>
<p>it&#x27;s very fine dining. It&#x27;s very</p>
<time>00:11:09</time>
<p>expensive. It&#x27;s like 20 to $40 a</p>
<time>00:11:12</time>
<p>meal. But anyway, some of the</p>
<time>00:11:13</time>
<p>stuff that&#x27;s said to happen</p>
<time>00:11:15</time>
<p>here, and this is considered</p>
<time>00:11:17</time>
<p>Long Island&#x27;s most haunted</p>
<time>00:11:18</time>
<p>place. So people are said to</p>
<time>00:11:22</time>
<p>have seen the ghost of William</p>
<time>00:11:23</time>
<p>Sidney Mount. So a man dressed</p>
<time>00:11:25</time>
<p>in 1800s garb walking in the</p>
<time>00:11:27</time>
<p>hallways, leaving footsteps,</p>
<time>00:11:30</time>
<p>workers at night locking up</p>
<time>00:11:32</time>
<p>would see him at the corner of</p>
<time>00:11:34</time>
<p>their eyes. It&#x27;s always like the</p>
<time>00:11:36</time>
<p>same description of the guy,</p>
<time>00:11:38</time>
<p>right? A lot of different things</p>
<time>00:11:39</time>
<p>with him, a lot of different</p>
<time>00:11:40</time>
<p>things with other male spirits</p>
<time>00:11:42</time>
<p>and, you know, EVP. So</p>
<time>00:11:45</time>
<p>recordings of disembodied voices</p>
<time>00:11:48</time>
<p>and all that, things like</p>
<time>00:11:49</time>
<p>candles being reignited. But the</p>
<time>00:11:52</time>
<p>most interesting story that</p>
<time>00:11:54</time>
<p>comes out of the country house</p>
<time>00:11:56</time>
<p>haunting is that of Annette</p>
<time>00:11:58</time>
<p>Williamson. So I&#x27;m gonna tell</p>
<time>00:12:01</time>
<p>you guys the story of Annette</p>
<time>00:12:02</time>
<p>Williamson. And then we&#x27;re gonna</p>
<time>00:12:03</time>
<p>see if there&#x27;s anything funky</p>
<time>00:12:04</time>
<p>about the story. So this story</p>
<time>00:12:06</time>
<p>comes from the owner, Bob, who</p>
<time>00:12:12</time>
<p>was told it by a random French</p>
<time>00:12:15</time>
<p>psychic who once visited the</p>
<time>00:12:18</time>
<p>restaurant years and years ago.</p>
<time>00:12:22</time>
<p>Like when he was the owner or</p>
<time>00:12:24</time>
<p>when he was a busboy? When he</p>
<time>00:12:26</time>
<p>was the owner, this random</p>
<time>00:12:27</time>
<p>French psychic showed up in town</p>
<time>00:12:29</time>
<p>late one night and was like, oh,</p>
<time>00:12:31</time>
<p>you&#x27;re there, Auguste in your</p>
<time>00:12:32</time>
<p>house. That&#x27;s my French accent.</p>
<time>00:12:34</time>
<p>It&#x27;s pretty good. And Bob was</p>
<time>00:12:36</time>
<p>like, oh, tell me about it. And</p>
<time>00:12:37</time>
<p>he sat and he told this whole</p>
<time>00:12:39</time>
<p>story. Then Long Island&#x27;s most</p>
<time>00:12:41</time>
<p>famous psychic duo, a lady named</p>
<time>00:12:45</time>
<p>Carrie Anne, now Long Island</p>
<time>00:12:47</time>
<p>Medium, Carrie Anne and Joe</p>
<time>00:12:50</time>
<p>Giaquinto is the guy. He&#x27;s a</p>
<time>00:12:53</time>
<p>paranormal investigator and he</p>
<time>00:12:54</time>
<p>considers himself a medium kind</p>
<time>00:12:57</time>
<p>of sensitive sort of. Yeah, he</p>
<time>00:12:59</time>
<p>considers himself that&#x27;s a good</p>
<time>00:13:00</time>
<p>way to put it, sensitive. They</p>
<time>00:13:03</time>
<p>have written books. They&#x27;ve</p>
<time>00:13:05</time>
<p>written many stories about this</p>
<time>00:13:06</time>
<p>because they claim to be in</p>
<time>00:13:07</time>
<p>contact with the ghost of</p>
<time>00:13:08</time>
<p>Annette Williamson. And they</p>
<time>00:13:11</time>
<p>verified her story and expanded</p>
<time>00:13:13</time>
<p>on it and documented it in books</p>
<time>00:13:16</time>
<p>and documentaries and local news</p>
<time>00:13:18</time>
<p>articles to the point where it&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:13:20</time>
<p>one of the most famous Long</p>
<time>00:13:21</time>
<p>Island haunted haunting stories.</p>
<time>00:13:23</time>
<p>So who is Annette Williamson?</p>
<time>00:13:25</time>
<p>Well, it&#x27;s said that the</p>
<time>00:13:27</time>
<p>Williamson family was a family</p>
<time>00:13:29</time>
<p>that owned the property at some</p>
<time>00:13:31</time>
<p>point during the Revolutionary</p>
<time>00:13:32</time>
<p>War, that period, right? And</p>
<time>00:13:34</time>
<p>it&#x27;s that they had several</p>
<time>00:13:35</time>
<p>children, the oldest of which</p>
<time>00:13:37</time>
<p>was Annette. She was only 17</p>
<time>00:13:40</time>
<p>years old, so the rest of the</p>
<time>00:13:42</time>
<p>kids must have been pretty</p>
<time>00:13:43</time>
<p>young. And it&#x27;s said that they</p>
<time>00:13:44</time>
<p>were a Dutch family living in</p>
<time>00:13:46</time>
<p>the area, right? And as the</p>
<time>00:13:48</time>
<p>story goes around the</p>
<time>00:13:49</time>
<p>Revolutionary War time, so just</p>
<time>00:13:51</time>
<p>as stuff is starting to heat up,</p>
<time>00:13:53</time>
<p>her parents had property in New</p>
<time>00:13:55</time>
<p>Jersey. I don&#x27;t know why they</p>
<time>00:13:57</time>
<p>would want to keep property in</p>
<time>00:13:58</time>
<p>that dirty state. But they</p>
<time>00:14:00</time>
<p>wanted to check up on it and</p>
<time>00:14:01</time>
<p>make sure that the British</p>
<time>00:14:03</time>
<p>weren&#x27;t destroying it or they</p>
<time>00:14:05</time>
<p>were in the area at the time and</p>
<time>00:14:06</time>
<p>they&#x27;re really worried about it</p>
<time>00:14:07</time>
<p>there. They must have been a</p>
<time>00:14:08</time>
<p>wealthy family to own this</p>
<time>00:14:10</time>
<p>property. It was pretty large.</p>
<time>00:14:12</time>
<p>So what they decided to do, they</p>
<time>00:14:13</time>
<p>decided to leave Annette home</p>
<time>00:14:15</time>
<p>alone to watch over the</p>
<time>00:14:16</time>
<p>household and the rest of the</p>
<time>00:14:18</time>
<p>family while they go on a trip</p>
<time>00:14:19</time>
<p>to just check on the property in</p>
<time>00:14:21</time>
<p>New Jersey. It was a pretty</p>
<time>00:14:22</time>
<p>dangerous trip as again, the</p>
<time>00:14:24</time>
<p>British are kind of in the area.</p>
<time>00:14:26</time>
<p>In fact, New York, I think was</p>
<time>00:14:27</time>
<p>controlled by the British for a</p>
<time>00:14:29</time>
<p>long time during the</p>
<time>00:14:29</time>
<p>Revolutionary War. So it</p>
<time>00:14:34</time>
<p>wouldn&#x27;t be an easy trip. It&#x27;d</p>
<time>00:14:35</time>
<p>be pretty difficult to do. And</p>
<time>00:14:37</time>
<p>there was actually a lot of</p>
<time>00:14:38</time>
<p>loyal loyalist supporters across</p>
<time>00:14:42</time>
<p>Long Island amongst farmers.</p>
<time>00:14:44</time>
<p>Stony Brook had a good mix of</p>
<time>00:14:48</time>
<p>pro-American citizens, but not a</p>
<time>00:14:51</time>
<p>good time to travel. And so</p>
<time>00:14:53</time>
<p>Annette was extremely distressed</p>
<time>00:14:56</time>
<p>by this. She begged them not to</p>
<time>00:14:57</time>
<p>leave, but they had to. And so</p>
<time>00:14:59</time>
<p>she was left alone, terrified to</p>
<time>00:15:02</time>
<p>fend for herself and her</p>
<time>00:15:03</time>
<p>siblings, not knowing when her</p>
<time>00:15:05</time>
<p>parents would get back. And of</p>
<time>00:15:07</time>
<p>course, she had nothing to</p>
<time>00:15:07</time>
<p>defend herself from the British.</p>
<time>00:15:10</time>
<p>She could do nothing. So lo and</p>
<time>00:15:11</time>
<p>behold, when the British came</p>
<time>00:15:12</time>
<p>and seeing a beautiful, huge</p>
<time>00:15:15</time>
<p>property demanded that Annette</p>
<time>00:15:19</time>
<p>allowed them to stay there. What</p>
<time>00:15:23</time>
<p>could she do? She had to say</p>
<time>00:15:24</time>
<p>yes, she couldn&#x27;t do anything</p>
<time>00:15:26</time>
<p>and she needed to keep herself</p>
<time>00:15:27</time>
<p>and her siblings safe. So she</p>
<time>00:15:29</time>
<p>let them stay. And so it said</p>
<time>00:15:31</time>
<p>for the period of time where the</p>
<time>00:15:32</time>
<p>British troops occupied the</p>
<time>00:15:34</time>
<p>property, Annette spent her days</p>
<time>00:15:36</time>
<p>just totally, totally depressed,</p>
<time>00:15:41</time>
<p>wandering around, sitting in the</p>
<time>00:15:43</time>
<p>old field room, which is on the</p>
<time>00:15:45</time>
<p>second floor. Nowadays, it&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:15:47</time>
<p>like a private party room in the</p>
<time>00:15:49</time>
<p>restaurant in the second floor,</p>
<time>00:15:51</time>
<p>sitting out, looking out the</p>
<time>00:15:52</time>
<p>window, just blankly staring,</p>
<time>00:15:55</time>
<p>waiting for her parents to</p>
<time>00:15:56</time>
<p>return. Every day, this is what</p>
<time>00:15:58</time>
<p>she would do. She&#x27;d just wander</p>
<time>00:15:59</time>
<p>around, just worried about her</p>
<time>00:16:01</time>
<p>parents, worried about keeping</p>
<time>00:16:03</time>
<p>after her siblings, worried</p>
<time>00:16:04</time>
<p>about the British, worried about</p>
<time>00:16:06</time>
<p>the war, and this one for a long</p>
<time>00:16:08</time>
<p>time. And unfortunately, her</p>
<time>00:16:11</time>
<p>parents never returned. They</p>
<time>00:16:13</time>
<p>were killed by the British in</p>
<time>00:16:15</time>
<p>New Jersey. And to make matters</p>
<time>00:16:17</time>
<p>worse, when the British left</p>
<time>00:16:19</time>
<p>finally, the townspeople didn&#x27;t</p>
<time>00:16:22</time>
<p>take too kindly to her housing</p>
<time>00:16:25</time>
<p>their enemy and they accused her</p>
<time>00:16:27</time>
<p>of being a British spy. And an</p>
<time>00:16:31</time>
<p>angry mob broke down the doors</p>
<time>00:16:33</time>
<p>and without any sort of trial,</p>
<time>00:16:36</time>
<p>murdered her and the rest of the</p>
<time>00:16:39</time>
<p>family and pulled blood. Like</p>
<time>00:16:41</time>
<p>all the other siblings? Yes,</p>
<time>00:16:44</time>
<p>yes. So keep in mind the</p>
<time>00:16:45</time>
<p>interesting parts of the story,</p>
<time>00:16:46</time>
<p>right? Now, there are</p>
<time>00:16:48</time>
<p>disagreeing records on whether</p>
<time>00:16:50</time>
<p>she was hanged in the old field</p>
<time>00:16:53</time>
<p>room near the fireplace or</p>
<time>00:16:56</time>
<p>murdered outside. But that&#x27;s the</p>
<time>00:16:59</time>
<p>story. She died and ever since</p>
<time>00:17:02</time>
<p>then, there have been countless,</p>
<time>00:17:05</time>
<p>countless, countless encounters</p>
<time>00:17:07</time>
<p>with her. The owner, Bob, tells</p>
<time>00:17:11</time>
<p>stories of closing up at night,</p>
<time>00:17:14</time>
<p>turning around the corner, and</p>
<time>00:17:15</time>
<p>bumping into a full apparition</p>
<time>00:17:18</time>
<p>of a young woman, blonde hair,</p>
<time>00:17:21</time>
<p>blue eyes, very pale, who turns</p>
<time>00:17:23</time>
<p>to look at him, is startled, has</p>
<time>00:17:25</time>
<p>a look of fear and surprise, and</p>
<time>00:17:28</time>
<p>just dissipates in front of him.</p>
<time>00:17:30</time>
<p>He&#x27;s had stuff like his tie</p>
<time>00:17:33</time>
<p>clip, which is a oddly specific</p>
<time>00:17:35</time>
<p>thing, disappear and reappear on</p>
<time>00:17:38</time>
<p>the fireplace where she was</p>
<time>00:17:40</time>
<p>supposedly hanged. But then it</p>
<time>00:17:42</time>
<p>gets even weirder because</p>
<time>00:17:43</time>
<p>there&#x27;s actually many, many,</p>
<time>00:17:44</time>
<p>many encounters that have had</p>
<time>00:17:46</time>
<p>many witnesses. He was once</p>
<time>00:17:49</time>
<p>closing out the restaurant with</p>
<time>00:17:51</time>
<p>an old friend who was very much</p>
<time>00:17:53</time>
<p>a skeptic and didn&#x27;t believe in</p>
<time>00:17:55</time>
<p>any of this sort of stuff at</p>
<time>00:17:56</time>
<p>all. They&#x27;re sitting down when</p>
<time>00:17:58</time>
<p>supposedly, and this is from the</p>
<time>00:18:00</time>
<p>person himself, a chair in the</p>
<time>00:18:02</time>
<p>restaurant is lifted up and</p>
<time>00:18:04</time>
<p>thrown at him. Oh, we got some</p>
<time>00:18:05</time>
<p>poltergeist stuff going on. Yes.</p>
<time>00:18:08</time>
<p>And as they turn to look, they</p>
<time>00:18:09</time>
<p>catch a glimpse of a white</p>
<time>00:18:10</time>
<p>dress, kind of flapping right</p>
<time>00:18:12</time>
<p>around like a corner as if</p>
<time>00:18:13</time>
<p>someone just escaped the room.</p>
<time>00:18:15</time>
<p>Well, they call a glimpse of</p>
<time>00:18:16</time>
<p>her. So there&#x27;s this seeming</p>
<time>00:18:18</time>
<p>like poltergeist kind of</p>
<time>00:18:19</time>
<p>trickery stuff going on with the</p>
<time>00:18:21</time>
<p>hiding of the tie pin as well.</p>
<time>00:18:24</time>
<p>But then you said he also just</p>
<time>00:18:26</time>
<p>ran into her basically, and she</p>
<time>00:18:28</time>
<p>dissipated. That doesn&#x27;t sound</p>
<time>00:18:31</time>
<p>as aggressive as the poltergeist</p>
<time>00:18:33</time>
<p>stuff. So if that&#x27;s true, as far</p>
<time>00:18:38</time>
<p>as hauntings go, I mean, you</p>
<time>00:18:40</time>
<p>said it&#x27;s the most haunted</p>
<time>00:18:41</time>
<p>place. There could just be</p>
<time>00:18:42</time>
<p>multiple things at work there</p>
<time>00:18:46</time>
<p>because it wouldn&#x27;t make, I</p>
<time>00:18:48</time>
<p>don&#x27;t feel like it would make</p>
<time>00:18:49</time>
<p>sense for for there to be</p>
<time>00:18:51</time>
<p>poltergeist activity from the</p>
<time>00:18:52</time>
<p>same thing that got startled and</p>
<time>00:18:54</time>
<p>then vanished. That&#x27;s a, keep</p>
<time>00:18:56</time>
<p>that in mind. That&#x27;s an</p>
<time>00:18:57</time>
<p>interesting point. Well, to add</p>
<time>00:19:00</time>
<p>to that, were any of the</p>
<time>00:19:02</time>
<p>siblings, like her sister, like</p>
<time>00:19:05</time>
<p>could it have been one of the</p>
<time>00:19:07</time>
<p>sisters instead of her or was</p>
<time>00:19:10</time>
<p>the account that it was probably</p>
<time>00:19:12</time>
<p>a net? All the encounters assume</p>
<time>00:19:15</time>
<p>that it&#x27;s a net. The stories</p>
<time>00:19:18</time>
<p>never give details on how many</p>
<time>00:19:21</time>
<p>siblings there were or how young</p>
<time>00:19:24</time>
<p>they were and how many guys, how</p>
<time>00:19:25</time>
<p>many girls. So it&#x27;s always</p>
<time>00:19:26</time>
<p>assumed to be a net. Basically</p>
<time>00:19:29</time>
<p>anything that happens in the</p>
<time>00:19:30</time>
<p>house is chalked up to a net to</p>
<time>00:19:33</time>
<p>a point where it&#x27;s kind of like</p>
<time>00:19:34</time>
<p>advertised for this restaurant</p>
<time>00:19:36</time>
<p>that you&#x27;ll get to experience</p>
<time>00:19:38</time>
<p>the ghost of a net because</p>
<time>00:19:40</time>
<p>evidently she&#x27;s very kind to</p>
<time>00:19:43</time>
<p>children. One day when a family</p>
<time>00:19:46</time>
<p>was dining there, evidently with</p>
<time>00:19:47</time>
<p>a young girl, like four or five</p>
<time>00:19:50</time>
<p>years old, the little girl would</p>
<time>00:19:51</time>
<p>keep getting up and trying to</p>
<time>00:19:53</time>
<p>get into the men&#x27;s bathroom. And</p>
<time>00:19:57</time>
<p>Bob the owner eventually came</p>
<time>00:19:59</time>
<p>over and was like, hi, can you</p>
<time>00:20:01</time>
<p>please tell your daughter to</p>
<time>00:20:03</time>
<p>stop? We can&#x27;t, you know, it&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:20:05</time>
<p>causing a scene. Just let her</p>
<time>00:20:07</time>
<p>know she can&#x27;t do that. And the</p>
<time>00:20:08</time>
<p>parents were really embarrassed</p>
<time>00:20:09</time>
<p>and mom was like, you know,</p>
<time>00:20:10</time>
<p>sweetie, you can&#x27;t go there.</p>
<time>00:20:13</time>
<p>That&#x27;s not for girls. That&#x27;s for</p>
<time>00:20:14</time>
<p>guys. Why are you trying to go</p>
<time>00:20:15</time>
<p>there? And the girl said, my</p>
<time>00:20:18</time>
<p>friend, my friend&#x27;s trying to</p>
<time>00:20:19</time>
<p>play hide and seek with me. She</p>
<time>00:20:21</time>
<p>wants me to follow her over</p>
<time>00:20:23</time>
<p>there. And they&#x27;re like, what?</p>
<time>00:20:25</time>
<p>And they asked the kid to</p>
<time>00:20:26</time>
<p>describe the girl or the friend</p>
<time>00:20:29</time>
<p>and she&#x27;s like, that&#x27;s a young</p>
<time>00:20:30</time>
<p>girl, young lady, blonde hair,</p>
<time>00:20:33</time>
<p>blue eyes. And she gives a</p>
<time>00:20:35</time>
<p>description exactly matching the</p>
<time>00:20:37</time>
<p>story of Annette Williamson.</p>
<time>00:20:38</time>
<p>Right. In that case, it&#x27;s like a</p>
<time>00:20:40</time>
<p>more friendly story, but there</p>
<time>00:20:41</time>
<p>are less friendly things really</p>
<time>00:20:43</time>
<p>kind of just eerie. Very often</p>
<time>00:20:46</time>
<p>workers would catch glimpses of</p>
<time>00:20:50</time>
<p>her when working outside. They&#x27;d</p>
<time>00:20:53</time>
<p>see a silhouette of a young</p>
<time>00:20:56</time>
<p>woman in the window, the same</p>
<time>00:20:57</time>
<p>window she was set to sit in</p>
<time>00:20:59</time>
<p>with like a really sad look and</p>
<time>00:21:01</time>
<p>something interesting. It said</p>
<time>00:21:03</time>
<p>that people who notice her in</p>
<time>00:21:06</time>
<p>that context are overcome with a</p>
<time>00:21:08</time>
<p>sense of sadness. And the owner,</p>
<time>00:21:10</time>
<p>Bob, has claimed that he&#x27;s even</p>
<time>00:21:11</time>
<p>seen people just start to cry</p>
<time>00:21:14</time>
<p>like out of nowhere, just be</p>
<time>00:21:15</time>
<p>affected that much by the, I</p>
<time>00:21:17</time>
<p>don&#x27;t know, by the atmosphere of</p>
<time>00:21:19</time>
<p>her presence that they just</p>
<time>00:21:21</time>
<p>start to weep. And the stories</p>
<time>00:21:24</time>
<p>go on from there. I mean, there</p>
<time>00:21:25</time>
<p>are stories of the one night in</p>
<time>00:21:26</time>
<p>like August of 1980. It&#x27;s really</p>
<time>00:21:29</time>
<p>hot out. You know, when</p>
<time>00:21:30</time>
<p>sometimes there&#x27;s like</p>
<time>00:21:31</time>
<p>lightning, even though there&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:21:32</time>
<p>no rain and it&#x27;s really humid</p>
<time>00:21:34</time>
<p>out like heat lightning. Yeah,</p>
<time>00:21:36</time>
<p>that&#x27;s fake, but continue. What</p>
<time>00:21:39</time>
<p>do you mean? Oh, it&#x27;s not. No,</p>
<time>00:21:45</time>
<p>but a lot of people believe that</p>
<time>00:21:48</time>
<p>because it&#x27;s hot out, that there</p>
<time>00:21:50</time>
<p>is lightning caused by the heat,</p>
<time>00:21:53</time>
<p>but it&#x27;s actually just far away</p>
<time>00:21:54</time>
<p>lightning. That is very</p>
<time>00:21:56</time>
<p>interesting. Okay, so there&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:21:58</time>
<p>far away lightning. And all the</p>
<time>00:22:00</time>
<p>lights in the house go out and</p>
<time>00:22:01</time>
<p>all the workers go outside and</p>
<time>00:22:03</time>
<p>they&#x27;re like, oh, what&#x27;s going</p>
<time>00:22:03</time>
<p>on? And they turn and they see,</p>
<time>00:22:06</time>
<p>even though all the lights are</p>
<time>00:22:07</time>
<p>out, there&#x27;s no power in the</p>
<time>00:22:11</time>
<p>window of the old field room on</p>
<time>00:22:13</time>
<p>the second floor, the lights are</p>
<time>00:22:14</time>
<p>on and it&#x27;s almost like a candle</p>
<time>00:22:16</time>
<p>light, like a flickering sort of</p>
<time>00:22:18</time>
<p>light. And they watch as the</p>
<time>00:22:20</time>
<p>shape of a young woman, long</p>
<time>00:22:22</time>
<p>hair, just a silhouette, walks</p>
<time>00:22:24</time>
<p>across the window. And all of a</p>
<time>00:22:26</time>
<p>sudden the lights go back on in</p>
<time>00:22:27</time>
<p>the house. They rush back in,</p>
<time>00:22:28</time>
<p>you know, they go up there. Of</p>
<time>00:22:30</time>
<p>course, there&#x27;s no one there. A</p>
<time>00:22:31</time>
<p>lot of weird stuff like that. A</p>
<time>00:22:32</time>
<p>lot of full-on apparitions of</p>
<time>00:22:35</time>
<p>this ghost, sights of her</p>
<time>00:22:37</time>
<p>silhouette, sights of her</p>
<time>00:22:38</time>
<p>upfront, playful things like,</p>
<time>00:22:41</time>
<p>you know, the tie clip</p>
<time>00:22:43</time>
<p>disappearing or candles,</p>
<time>00:22:45</time>
<p>relighting themselves, that</p>
<time>00:22:47</time>
<p>chair being thrown across. Yeah,</p>
<time>00:22:48</time>
<p>just playful. Yeah. And they</p>
<time>00:22:50</time>
<p>always hear stuff like footsteps</p>
<time>00:22:53</time>
<p>and all sorts of things. In</p>
<time>00:22:54</time>
<p>fact, I saw an account of a</p>
<time>00:22:56</time>
<p>worker who claimed to have</p>
<time>00:22:57</time>
<p>worked there back in the day who</p>
<time>00:22:59</time>
<p>claimed that basically on some</p>
<time>00:23:01</time>
<p>quiet nights after like closing,</p>
<time>00:23:04</time>
<p>the workers would just like hang</p>
<time>00:23:05</time>
<p>out at the bar there and have</p>
<time>00:23:07</time>
<p>fun just waiting for something</p>
<time>00:23:08</time>
<p>to happen. Like this stuff was</p>
<time>00:23:09</time>
<p>that common. They&#x27;d hear voices,</p>
<time>00:23:11</time>
<p>they&#x27;d hear footsteps, they&#x27;d</p>
<time>00:23:12</time>
<p>hear or they&#x27;d see silhouettes,</p>
<time>00:23:15</time>
<p>they&#x27;d see things move. And the</p>
<time>00:23:17</time>
<p>wine cellar in the basement</p>
<time>00:23:18</time>
<p>supposedly wine bottles</p>
<time>00:23:19</time>
<p>sometimes will just fly off the</p>
<time>00:23:21</time>
<p>walls and wine glasses will</p>
<time>00:23:23</time>
<p>smash in front of people&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:23:24</time>
<p>faces. And it&#x27;s all checked up</p>
<time>00:23:26</time>
<p>to Annette Williamson. That</p>
<time>00:23:27</time>
<p>would happen at my work. The</p>
<time>00:23:30</time>
<p>heck? Do you? Right. Now when</p>
<time>00:23:32</time>
<p>you have to clean it. True.</p>
<time>00:23:34</time>
<p>Yeah. But so yeah, there&#x27;s just</p>
<time>00:23:37</time>
<p>a lot of stuff here. And one of</p>
<time>00:23:39</time>
<p>the craziest claims I&#x27;ve heard</p>
<time>00:23:41</time>
<p>is that like when people listen</p>
<time>00:23:43</time>
<p>to music in the restaurant at</p>
<time>00:23:44</time>
<p>night, like the owner will have</p>
<time>00:23:45</time>
<p>like a radio on, the ghost of</p>
<time>00:23:47</time>
<p>Annette will mess with the radio</p>
<time>00:23:49</time>
<p>because she loves music. And</p>
<time>00:23:51</time>
<p>she&#x27;ll turn the knobs and</p>
<time>00:23:52</time>
<p>they&#x27;ll be like, Annette, what</p>
<time>00:23:54</time>
<p>are you doing? So evidently she</p>
<time>00:23:56</time>
<p>loves music. She loves kids. She</p>
<time>00:23:57</time>
<p>loves music. All great. Crank up</p>
<time>00:24:00</time>
<p>some AC DC that they put on</p>
<time>00:24:01</time>
<p>after closing. Exactly. She just</p>
<time>00:24:03</time>
<p>jams out to some classic rock.</p>
<time>00:24:05</time>
<p>That&#x27;s kind of interesting that</p>
<time>00:24:06</time>
<p>she&#x27;s very, you know, attached</p>
<time>00:24:08</time>
<p>to the music kind of thing</p>
<time>00:24:09</time>
<p>because radios weren&#x27;t really</p>
<time>00:24:12</time>
<p>too common or I don&#x27;t even think</p>
<time>00:24:14</time>
<p>they were a thing back then.</p>
<time>00:24:16</time>
<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s good. Yeah. So I</p>
<time>00:24:18</time>
<p>don&#x27;t, I mean, obviously people</p>
<time>00:24:20</time>
<p>had music for centuries and</p>
<time>00:24:22</time>
<p>centuries, but it&#x27;s interesting</p>
<time>00:24:24</time>
<p>to think that new technology is</p>
<time>00:24:27</time>
<p>impacting the old behaviors of</p>
<time>00:24:30</time>
<p>the ghost. Ghosts can learn. You</p>
<time>00:24:33</time>
<p>think that means they can use</p>
<time>00:24:33</time>
<p>iPhones as well? They could like</p>
<time>00:24:36</time>
<p>pause your Spotify. No, but they</p>
<time>00:24:38</time>
<p>might be able to type in the</p>
<time>00:24:39</time>
<p>chat GPT if they possess your</p>
<time>00:24:41</time>
<p>computer. That is just what chat</p>
<time>00:24:43</time>
<p>GPT is. AI are just ghosts.</p>
<time>00:24:48</time>
<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s just like ghosts. But</p>
<time>00:24:50</time>
<p>great. So we have all these</p>
<time>00:24:52</time>
<p>accounts. I mean, you even have</p>
<time>00:24:54</time>
<p>accounts of people, like random</p>
<time>00:24:56</time>
<p>people driving by at night and</p>
<time>00:24:59</time>
<p>seeing the silhouette of Annette</p>
<time>00:25:02</time>
<p>Williamson in the window and</p>
<time>00:25:04</time>
<p>being overcome with sadness. So</p>
<time>00:25:07</time>
<p>from a distance. While the yeah,</p>
<time>00:25:09</time>
<p>so while the original story kind</p>
<time>00:25:11</time>
<p>of comes from that French</p>
<time>00:25:11</time>
<p>sidekick that passes to the</p>
<time>00:25:12</time>
<p>owner and then the Carrie Anne</p>
<time>00:25:15</time>
<p>and Joe kind of running with it</p>
<time>00:25:16</time>
<p>and claiming to be in contact</p>
<time>00:25:18</time>
<p>with her when they visit, you</p>
<time>00:25:20</time>
<p>don&#x27;t have just sightings</p>
<time>00:25:21</time>
<p>limited to those people. You</p>
<time>00:25:23</time>
<p>have normal if you look at the</p>
<time>00:25:25</time>
<p>reviews on Google Maps of this</p>
<time>00:25:27</time>
<p>place and you search for haunted</p>
<time>00:25:29</time>
<p>or ghost, people will reference</p>
<time>00:25:31</time>
<p>her and be like, love the</p>
<time>00:25:32</time>
<p>atmosphere, love the friendly</p>
<time>00:25:35</time>
<p>spirits, love Annette, always</p>
<time>00:25:36</time>
<p>great to visit her. And it&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:25:38</time>
<p>like, it&#x27;s weird. So I&#x27;d love to</p>
<time>00:25:40</time>
<p>go there. I think this summer we</p>
<time>00:25:41</time>
<p>should try going there. If you</p>
<time>00:25:42</time>
<p>guys come down, we&#x27;ll visit it.</p>
<time>00:25:44</time>
<p>Yeah. Well, quick question. You</p>
<time>00:25:46</time>
<p>said so like, I&#x27;m still hung up</p>
<time>00:25:47</time>
<p>on that throwing the chair. Has</p>
<time>00:25:49</time>
<p>anyone been hurt? Because you</p>
<time>00:25:51</time>
<p>know, you hear stories of people</p>
<time>00:25:52</time>
<p>getting scratched or like being</p>
<time>00:25:54</time>
<p>pushed downstairs with like</p>
<time>00:25:56</time>
<p>these kind of more also these</p>
<time>00:25:58</time>
<p>poltergeist things. So I&#x27;m just</p>
<time>00:26:00</time>
<p>wondering if someone&#x27;s been hurt</p>
<time>00:26:02</time>
<p>and then like they also just</p>
<time>00:26:03</time>
<p>chalk it up to Annette when I</p>
<time>00:26:05</time>
<p>mean, there are reviews saying,</p>
<time>00:26:06</time>
<p>oh, she&#x27;s great. We love her.</p>
<time>00:26:08</time>
<p>That&#x27;s a good question. I think</p>
<time>00:26:11</time>
<p>not good for business,</p>
<time>00:26:12</time>
<p>obviously. So they might not</p>
<time>00:26:14</time>
<p>really. So yeah, so that&#x27;s an</p>
<time>00:26:16</time>
<p>interesting point. The business</p>
<time>00:26:17</time>
<p>will always tell like the cute,</p>
<time>00:26:19</time>
<p>the cutesy stories about</p>
<time>00:26:20</time>
<p>Annette. Paranormal</p>
<time>00:26:23</time>
<p>investigators that come to visit</p>
<time>00:26:24</time>
<p>and write books often tell more</p>
<time>00:26:26</time>
<p>of the other stories like EVPs</p>
<time>00:26:28</time>
<p>that might have more the ones</p>
<time>00:26:30</time>
<p>I&#x27;ve listened to stuff are just</p>
<time>00:26:32</time>
<p>voices saying, come. So not not</p>
<time>00:26:35</time>
<p>spooky, but the like the</p>
<time>00:26:38</time>
<p>restaurant doesn&#x27;t advertise the</p>
<time>00:26:39</time>
<p>throwing chair story. Well,</p>
<time>00:26:41</time>
<p>yeah, I mean, I was just curious</p>
<time>00:26:42</time>
<p>if any, you know, yeah, no, I</p>
<time>00:26:45</time>
<p>don&#x27;t I haven&#x27;t heard of any</p>
<time>00:26:47</time>
<p>other violent things besides</p>
<time>00:26:49</time>
<p>throwing wine glasses and wine</p>
<time>00:26:52</time>
<p>bottles off. That&#x27;s that&#x27;s kind</p>
<time>00:26:53</time>
<p>of that&#x27;s not peaceful. I&#x27;m</p>
<time>00:26:56</time>
<p>wondering if it very well could</p>
<time>00:26:59</time>
<p>be Annette in both the peaceful</p>
<time>00:27:01</time>
<p>and, you know, a little bit more</p>
<time>00:27:03</time>
<p>violent scenarios. I&#x27;m wondering</p>
<time>00:27:04</time>
<p>if she&#x27;s just reacts to people</p>
<time>00:27:06</time>
<p>differently. Like she may see,</p>
<time>00:27:09</time>
<p>you know, a white strong man and</p>
<time>00:27:12</time>
<p>think, OK, you&#x27;re probably one</p>
<time>00:27:14</time>
<p>of the British. I don&#x27;t really</p>
<time>00:27:16</time>
<p>like you because you got me in</p>
<time>00:27:18</time>
<p>and killed or, you know, maybe</p>
<time>00:27:21</time>
<p>one of the townspeople that had</p>
<time>00:27:23</time>
<p>her hung or executed, maybe</p>
<time>00:27:27</time>
<p>someone looked like that. And</p>
<time>00:27:28</time>
<p>that&#x27;s what caused the reaction.</p>
<time>00:27:31</time>
<p>Yeah, she kind of taking taking</p>
<time>00:27:32</time>
<p>her biases to the grave.</p>
<time>00:27:35</time>
<p>Discriminatory. Well, we have</p>
<time>00:27:36</time>
<p>all this evidence of Annette</p>
<time>00:27:38</time>
<p>Williamson, her tragic story,</p>
<time>00:27:41</time>
<p>her tragic tale, her poor</p>
<time>00:27:43</time>
<p>family. Right. You think like</p>
<time>00:27:44</time>
<p>there&#x27;d be a lot of spirits at</p>
<time>00:27:46</time>
<p>this place for her whole family.</p>
<time>00:27:48</time>
<p>So all the kids, the parents</p>
<time>00:27:50</time>
<p>killed in New Jersey. There&#x27;s no</p>
<time>00:27:52</time>
<p>worse way to go out than being</p>
<time>00:27:53</time>
<p>killed in New Jersey by British</p>
<time>00:27:54</time>
<p>people. All right. Wow. True.</p>
<time>00:27:59</time>
<p>Wait. That&#x27;s only half of the</p>
<time>00:28:04</time>
<p>story because as far as I can</p>
<time>00:28:06</time>
<p>tell, Annette Williamson never</p>
<time>00:28:10</time>
<p>existed. Oh, good. She doesn&#x27;t</p>
<time>00:28:14</time>
<p>exist. So is it like a publicity</p>
<time>00:28:18</time>
<p>stunt from the restaurant? I</p>
<time>00:28:21</time>
<p>don&#x27;t know. Well, this was a</p>
<time>00:28:23</time>
<p>story from the French psychic,</p>
<time>00:28:25</time>
<p>right? Let&#x27;s let&#x27;s roll back.</p>
<time>00:28:28</time>
<p>Let&#x27;s go to this guy all the way</p>
<time>00:28:29</time>
<p>back. Let&#x27;s roll all the way</p>
<time>00:28:31</time>
<p>back to the history of this</p>
<time>00:28:32</time>
<p>place. So I found the history of</p>
<time>00:28:35</time>
<p>this place back to 1710. All</p>
<time>00:28:37</time>
<p>different people. It&#x27;s passed</p>
<time>00:28:39</time>
<p>down through the entire history</p>
<time>00:28:41</time>
<p>of Stony Brook, the families</p>
<time>00:28:43</time>
<p>there, the development of Stony</p>
<time>00:28:46</time>
<p>Brook, the historical figures</p>
<time>00:28:47</time>
<p>here. And as I started reading</p>
<time>00:28:50</time>
<p>the story of Annette Williamson,</p>
<time>00:28:52</time>
<p>while also the history of Stony</p>
<time>00:28:53</time>
<p>Brook and the house and the</p>
<time>00:28:54</time>
<p>ownership, I was like, wait a</p>
<time>00:28:56</time>
<p>minute, this doesn&#x27;t all this</p>
<time>00:28:58</time>
<p>doesn&#x27;t make sense. And I found</p>
<time>00:28:59</time>
<p>a great blog post that pointed</p>
<time>00:29:00</time>
<p>this out too, and did some</p>
<time>00:29:01</time>
<p>digging and I did some digging</p>
<time>00:29:03</time>
<p>based on that. So there are a</p>
<time>00:29:06</time>
<p>bunch of inconsistencies with</p>
<time>00:29:08</time>
<p>the Annette story that we&#x27;re</p>
<time>00:29:11</time>
<p>going to go into. Wonderful.</p>
<time>00:29:13</time>
<p>Number one, there was never a</p>
<time>00:29:17</time>
<p>Williamson family that owns the</p>
<time>00:29:19</time>
<p>property. That&#x27;s a pretty big</p>
<time>00:29:21</time>
<p>red flag. You just checked that</p>
<time>00:29:23</time>
<p>with like deed like records.</p>
<time>00:29:25</time>
<p>Yeah. So at the time, the Davis</p>
<time>00:29:30</time>
<p>family who originally built the</p>
<time>00:29:34</time>
<p>property still owned it. They</p>
<time>00:29:36</time>
<p>owned it for like four</p>
<time>00:29:38</time>
<p>generations. So well past the</p>
<time>00:29:39</time>
<p>American Revolution, it was</p>
<time>00:29:41</time>
<p>owned by the Davis family.</p>
<time>00:29:42</time>
<p>That&#x27;s like a hundred years at</p>
<time>00:29:43</time>
<p>least. Yeah, right. So there</p>
<time>00:29:45</time>
<p>wasn&#x27;t a Williamson family that</p>
<time>00:29:46</time>
<p>owned it. There was a Williamson</p>
<time>00:29:48</time>
<p>family that lived in the area,</p>
<time>00:29:52</time>
<p>actually around the corner. I</p>
<time>00:29:53</time>
<p>was just about to ask if they</p>
<time>00:29:54</time>
<p>were like friends or neighbors</p>
<time>00:29:56</time>
<p>or something. They were</p>
<time>00:29:58</time>
<p>neighbors, but that was in like</p>
<time>00:30:00</time>
<p>the early to mid 1800s, nowhere</p>
<time>00:30:04</time>
<p>near 1776. On top of that, the</p>
<time>00:30:10</time>
<p>name Annette just wasn&#x27;t used at</p>
<time>00:30:14</time>
<p>the time. That is not a name</p>
<time>00:30:16</time>
<p>that was used in the colonies</p>
<time>00:30:18</time>
<p>slash America. Well, are there</p>
<time>00:30:21</time>
<p>in the late 1700s? There are</p>
<time>00:30:24</time>
<p>like almost no records of that</p>
<time>00:30:26</time>
<p>name. And there wouldn&#x27;t be any</p>
<time>00:30:27</time>
<p>like census records going back</p>
<time>00:30:28</time>
<p>that far really. There actually</p>
<time>00:30:30</time>
<p>are. There actually are a lot of</p>
<time>00:30:32</time>
<p>death records and that. We&#x27;re</p>
<time>00:30:36</time>
<p>gonna get into that but not like</p>
<time>00:30:38</time>
<p>US census, you know, because</p>
<time>00:30:39</time>
<p>that wasn&#x27;t a thing. Yeah, there</p>
<time>00:30:40</time>
<p>are records, but yeah, they&#x27;re</p>
<time>00:30:42</time>
<p>pretty flaky. But I was able to</p>
<time>00:30:44</time>
<p>find the Williamson&#x27;s that lived</p>
<time>00:30:46</time>
<p>there and died there, which</p>
<time>00:30:48</time>
<p>we&#x27;ll talk about in a moment.</p>
<time>00:30:50</time>
<p>But on top of that, even before</p>
<time>00:30:51</time>
<p>we get to the damning evidence,</p>
<time>00:30:54</time>
<p>Annette isn&#x27;t a common name at</p>
<time>00:30:55</time>
<p>the time. Williamson isn&#x27;t a</p>
<time>00:30:59</time>
<p>Dutch last name. It&#x27;s English</p>
<time>00:31:01</time>
<p>and Scottish. Okay. So the name</p>
<time>00:31:04</time>
<p>Annette isn&#x27;t the last name</p>
<time>00:31:06</time>
<p>isn&#x27;t Dutch. The name wasn&#x27;t</p>
<time>00:31:08</time>
<p>used for like generations later.</p>
<time>00:31:12</time>
<p>The family never owned the</p>
<time>00:31:13</time>
<p>property. There was the family</p>
<time>00:31:15</time>
<p>that lived in the area</p>
<time>00:31:16</time>
<p>generations later. So I&#x27;m</p>
<time>00:31:19</time>
<p>wondering, how can this story,</p>
<time>00:31:21</time>
<p>there&#x27;s so many questions from</p>
<time>00:31:22</time>
<p>that. Like people see the ghost</p>
<time>00:31:25</time>
<p>of Annette Williamson. Yeah, or</p>
<time>00:31:26</time>
<p>something. They see her. They</p>
<time>00:31:29</time>
<p>see something that fits the</p>
<time>00:31:30</time>
<p>description of Annette and it&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:31:35</time>
<p>mostly hanged in. Right? So I</p>
<time>00:31:38</time>
<p>descends out that the evidence</p>
<time>00:31:39</time>
<p>that&#x27;s proposed for this story</p>
<time>00:31:42</time>
<p>is that if you go to the Oba</p>
<time>00:31:45</time>
<p>Diah Davis cemetery in the back</p>
<time>00:31:47</time>
<p>of their property, you&#x27;ll see</p>
<time>00:31:49</time>
<p>the Williamson family tombstones</p>
<time>00:31:52</time>
<p>and you&#x27;ll see in the net,</p>
<time>00:31:55</time>
<p>you&#x27;ll see a John Williamson and</p>
<time>00:31:58</time>
<p>then the net Williamson. Let me</p>
<time>00:32:00</time>
<p>send you guys the link here. I</p>
<time>00:32:03</time>
<p>found the tombs and pictures of</p>
<time>00:32:07</time>
<p>the tombs. So they do have them.</p>
<time>00:32:09</time>
<p>The people buried here. You just</p>
<time>00:32:11</time>
<p>can&#x27;t visit there, but there are</p>
<time>00:32:12</time>
<p>pictures of the stuff in the</p>
<time>00:32:15</time>
<p>cemetery. It seems like you can</p>
<time>00:32:17</time>
<p>ask to go there. And what&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:32:18</time>
<p>interesting, the reason we have</p>
<time>00:32:19</time>
<p>these pictures and the dates and</p>
<time>00:32:21</time>
<p>the names is because a</p>
<time>00:32:23</time>
<p>descendant of Oba Diah Davis</p>
<time>00:32:27</time>
<p>living today went there and</p>
<time>00:32:30</time>
<p>documented it all on this</p>
<time>00:32:32</time>
<p>website, find a grave and</p>
<time>00:32:34</time>
<p>documented all his ancestors and</p>
<time>00:32:37</time>
<p>the other people who lived here.</p>
<time>00:32:39</time>
<p>Have you guys scroll through</p>
<time>00:32:39</time>
<p>this list, which I&#x27;ll have in</p>
<time>00:32:40</time>
<p>the show notes. Do you guys see</p>
<time>00:32:42</time>
<p>Annette Williamson? I see a</p>
<time>00:32:43</time>
<p>Hannah, a John, and a William</p>
<time>00:32:46</time>
<p>Williamson, real creative guys.</p>
<time>00:32:48</time>
<p>And when did they die? The mid</p>
<time>00:32:50</time>
<p>1800s. Yep. We&#x27;ve got 1827 for</p>
<time>00:32:54</time>
<p>Hannah, 1844 for John, 1831 for</p>
<time>00:32:58</time>
<p>William. It just doesn&#x27;t line</p>
<time>00:33:00</time>
<p>up. There&#x27;s no Annette</p>
<time>00:33:02</time>
<p>Williamson. There weren&#x27;t</p>
<time>00:33:04</time>
<p>Williamson&#x27;s that died in this</p>
<time>00:33:06</time>
<p>area or on that property that</p>
<time>00:33:08</time>
<p>time. Now, let me play devil&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:33:12</time>
<p>advocate for a quick second and</p>
<time>00:33:13</time>
<p>give some highly unplausible</p>
<time>00:33:16</time>
<p>explanation. Yeah, of course.</p>
<time>00:33:17</time>
<p>But it could be very well that</p>
<time>00:33:21</time>
<p>there may have been an Annette</p>
<time>00:33:24</time>
<p>Williamson, but there could have</p>
<time>00:33:26</time>
<p>been something that happened,</p>
<time>00:33:29</time>
<p>like some kind of illegitimate</p>
<time>00:33:31</time>
<p>marriage or birth or something</p>
<time>00:33:33</time>
<p>with her involved. And of</p>
<time>00:33:34</time>
<p>course, back then, you know,</p>
<time>00:33:37</time>
<p>women didn&#x27;t really have a lot</p>
<time>00:33:39</time>
<p>going for them. So if there was</p>
<time>00:33:40</time>
<p>a situation like that, you know,</p>
<time>00:33:43</time>
<p>she would probably get in the</p>
<time>00:33:44</time>
<p>most, you know, trouble if</p>
<time>00:33:47</time>
<p>anything like that happened</p>
<time>00:33:48</time>
<p>rather than the man. So it could</p>
<time>00:33:50</time>
<p>have just been like something</p>
<time>00:33:51</time>
<p>happened. They didn&#x27;t want that,</p>
<time>00:33:53</time>
<p>you know, quote stain on their</p>
<time>00:33:56</time>
<p>family. And maybe it&#x27;s she could</p>
<time>00:33:58</time>
<p>have just been buried in some</p>
<time>00:34:00</time>
<p>unmarked grave. That&#x27;s I know,</p>
<time>00:34:03</time>
<p>again, far fetched. But like,</p>
<time>00:34:05</time>
<p>well, see my she was that my</p>
<time>00:34:09</time>
<p>issue with that is there are</p>
<time>00:34:11</time>
<p>Williamson tombstones there like</p>
<time>00:34:14</time>
<p>Frank has shown us. Right. And</p>
<time>00:34:17</time>
<p>they&#x27;re well past the date of</p>
<time>00:34:19</time>
<p>the American Revolution, which</p>
<time>00:34:20</time>
<p>doesn&#x27;t add up with the story of</p>
<time>00:34:22</time>
<p>them all dying. Like supposedly</p>
<time>00:34:25</time>
<p>the the way that Frank has told</p>
<time>00:34:28</time>
<p>the first half of the story is</p>
<time>00:34:29</time>
<p>that the bloodline of the</p>
<time>00:34:32</time>
<p>Williamson, at least in that</p>
<time>00:34:33</time>
<p>area, died out that night. Yeah.</p>
<time>00:34:38</time>
<p>I mean, the only thing I could</p>
<time>00:34:39</time>
<p>say to that would be like, maybe</p>
<time>00:34:42</time>
<p>the psychic got it wrong and it</p>
<time>00:34:45</time>
<p>was the Civil War and some</p>
<time>00:34:47</time>
<p>Southerners or some Southern</p>
<time>00:34:49</time>
<p>sympathizers killed them. That&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:34:51</time>
<p>that&#x27;s actually again, this is</p>
<time>00:34:53</time>
<p>that&#x27;s just solely yeah, she did</p>
<time>00:34:56</time>
<p>exist and just trying to come up</p>
<time>00:34:58</time>
<p>with something about maybe why</p>
<time>00:35:00</time>
<p>she&#x27;s not there. Very unlikely</p>
<time>00:35:02</time>
<p>that any of this I never thought</p>
<time>00:35:04</time>
<p>of the ballot. Yeah, I mean,</p>
<time>00:35:07</time>
<p>even the civil like, because</p>
<time>00:35:09</time>
<p>yeah, that but even then that&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:35:10</time>
<p>still before the great the</p>
<time>00:35:12</time>
<p>deaths of the people that still</p>
<time>00:35:14</time>
<p>before so like, again, just to</p>
<time>00:35:17</time>
<p>think of something about maybe</p>
<time>00:35:19</time>
<p>why she could be, you know, a</p>
<time>00:35:21</time>
<p>real person. Yeah. That&#x27;s that&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:35:24</time>
<p>an important thing to know. It</p>
<time>00:35:25</time>
<p>definitely is possible that</p>
<time>00:35:27</time>
<p>there was an Annette Williamson</p>
<time>00:35:28</time>
<p>who lived maybe, right, maybe</p>
<time>00:35:31</time>
<p>they didn&#x27;t own the property,</p>
<time>00:35:33</time>
<p>maybe, maybe parts of the story</p>
<time>00:35:36</time>
<p>are true, right? Yeah. And yes,</p>
<time>00:35:38</time>
<p>maybe we just don&#x27;t have the</p>
<time>00:35:39</time>
<p>records of it and it doesn&#x27;t</p>
<time>00:35:40</time>
<p>line up. Maybe there is a spirit</p>
<time>00:35:42</time>
<p>of her whatever reason still</p>
<time>00:35:43</time>
<p>there. However, given what</p>
<time>00:35:48</time>
<p>evidence does exist, when you</p>
<time>00:35:51</time>
<p>look into it, there actually is</p>
<time>00:35:53</time>
<p>no physical evidence to support</p>
<time>00:35:57</time>
<p>the story. At all. Everything</p>
<time>00:36:01</time>
<p>unfortunately came from that one</p>
<time>00:36:02</time>
<p>original psychic, as far as I</p>
<time>00:36:04</time>
<p>can tell, and the follow up</p>
<time>00:36:06</time>
<p>psychics and mediums that claim</p>
<time>00:36:07</time>
<p>to be in contact. Do we have the</p>
<time>00:36:09</time>
<p>name of the original French</p>
<time>00:36:11</time>
<p>psychic or I could not find it</p>
<time>00:36:14</time>
<p>now. If I can find it, I&#x27;ll put</p>
<time>00:36:16</time>
<p>in the show. The asking. Do you</p>
<time>00:36:20</time>
<p>remember what that guy&#x27;s name</p>
<time>00:36:21</time>
<p>was? I am actually debating</p>
<time>00:36:25</time>
<p>calling up the restaurant or</p>
<time>00:36:29</time>
<p>sending an email and not being,</p>
<time>00:36:31</time>
<p>you know, critical and saying,</p>
<time>00:36:33</time>
<p>the story you tell us. No, of</p>
<time>00:36:35</time>
<p>course. He doesn&#x27;t. What is true</p>
<time>00:36:38</time>
<p>is that people see something,</p>
<time>00:36:40</time>
<p>right? They experience</p>
<time>00:36:41</time>
<p>something. They see a ghost of a</p>
<time>00:36:43</time>
<p>young woman. They see stuff fly</p>
<time>00:36:46</time>
<p>off shelves. They get chairs,</p>
<time>00:36:47</time>
<p>chairs, they get candles, relit.</p>
<time>00:36:49</time>
<p>They see things. They hear</p>
<time>00:36:50</time>
<p>things. They experience things.</p>
<time>00:36:53</time>
<p>That&#x27;s I don&#x27;t doubt. Right. Me</p>
<time>00:36:55</time>
<p>neither. Then what&#x27;s going on?</p>
<time>00:36:57</time>
<p>We have an unidentified spookum.</p>
<time>00:37:00</time>
<p>What is going on? Isn&#x27;t that I</p>
<time>00:37:01</time>
<p>feel like that&#x27;s even more</p>
<time>00:37:03</time>
<p>interesting than it being true.</p>
<time>00:37:05</time>
<p>Personally, I think story of an</p>
<time>00:37:06</time>
<p>interesting things. They just</p>
<time>00:37:07</time>
<p>don&#x27;t make sense. Why would the</p>
<time>00:37:08</time>
<p>whole, like the British soldiers</p>
<time>00:37:10</time>
<p>just murdered a bunch of babies,</p>
<time>00:37:11</time>
<p>like a bunch of kids. They&#x27;re</p>
<time>00:37:13</time>
<p>not monsters. Why did the</p>
<time>00:37:14</time>
<p>parents die? But the historical</p>
<time>00:37:16</time>
<p>record clear. I mean, I found</p>
<time>00:37:17</time>
<p>documents from Stony Brook going</p>
<time>00:37:19</time>
<p>back to like that were published</p>
<time>00:37:21</time>
<p>in like 1907, showing pictures</p>
<time>00:37:23</time>
<p>and giving the history. And</p>
<time>00:37:25</time>
<p>there&#x27;s never ever any</p>
<time>00:37:26</time>
<p>historical record, any mention</p>
<time>00:37:30</time>
<p>of a Williamson family owning</p>
<time>00:37:32</time>
<p>it. It&#x27;s always Obadiah Davis</p>
<time>00:37:33</time>
<p>for generations and Thomas</p>
<time>00:37:36</time>
<p>Hadaway for many years. Then</p>
<time>00:37:39</time>
<p>what&#x27;s going on? Right.</p>
<time>00:37:41</time>
<p>Unfortunately, I think some</p>
<time>00:37:43</time>
<p>people are being a little</p>
<time>00:37:44</time>
<p>untruthful for maybe different</p>
<time>00:37:45</time>
<p>reasons. That is the psychics</p>
<time>00:37:48</time>
<p>claim that if you go to the</p>
<time>00:37:50</time>
<p>cemetery, you will see her</p>
<time>00:37:51</time>
<p>tombstone. That&#x27;s just not true.</p>
<time>00:37:55</time>
<p>The two psychics, I forget their</p>
<time>00:37:58</time>
<p>name. Yeah. I watched an hour</p>
<time>00:38:01</time>
<p>and a half long presentation by</p>
<time>00:38:02</time>
<p>them and I feel like I&#x27;m I&#x27;ll</p>
<time>00:38:06</time>
<p>link to in the show notes. I</p>
<time>00:38:07</time>
<p>hope no one, I hope this doesn&#x27;t</p>
<time>00:38:08</time>
<p>get back to them. But they talk</p>
<time>00:38:11</time>
<p>about, I mean, I went through</p>
<time>00:38:12</time>
<p>that video and I found just, I</p>
<time>00:38:14</time>
<p>kept track of all the things</p>
<time>00:38:15</time>
<p>that were, that appeared to be</p>
<time>00:38:16</time>
<p>factually incorrect with what</p>
<time>00:38:18</time>
<p>they were saying. They had a</p>
<time>00:38:20</time>
<p>little slideshow. They claimed</p>
<time>00:38:21</time>
<p>that there&#x27;s only two tombstones</p>
<time>00:38:22</time>
<p>of Williamson&#x27;s at the cemetery.</p>
<time>00:38:24</time>
<p>And one of them is Annette. The</p>
<time>00:38:26</time>
<p>other one is John. That&#x27;s not</p>
<time>00:38:27</time>
<p>true. There&#x27;s three. And there&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:38:30</time>
<p>no Annette. Maybe, I don&#x27;t know,</p>
<time>00:38:33</time>
<p>how do you get Annette from like</p>
<time>00:38:34</time>
<p>Hannah or John or Willy? Is</p>
<time>00:38:36</time>
<p>there any weird, like old, old,</p>
<time>00:38:40</time>
<p>like translation or something of</p>
<time>00:38:43</time>
<p>like Annette to Hannah in any</p>
<time>00:38:45</time>
<p>way? Not that I even see. I</p>
<time>00:38:48</time>
<p>don&#x27;t think so. Yeah. Doesn&#x27;t</p>
<time>00:38:49</time>
<p>sound very likely. But the only</p>
<time>00:38:52</time>
<p>thing some related to that is of</p>
<time>00:39:01</time>
<p>the Dutch last name. So like</p>
<time>00:39:03</time>
<p>they could maybe they&#x27;re, you</p>
<time>00:39:05</time>
<p>know, because I point out it&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:39:06</time>
<p>not even the Dutch name. It</p>
<time>00:39:08</time>
<p>could, you know, it could have</p>
<time>00:39:09</time>
<p>been a Dutch name that was</p>
<time>00:39:10</time>
<p>turned into a more English name.</p>
<time>00:39:11</time>
<p>Perhaps. In the colonies. But</p>
<time>00:39:14</time>
<p>yeah, just really, it doesn&#x27;t</p>
<time>00:39:16</time>
<p>line up. But it makes me wonder</p>
<time>00:39:17</time>
<p>because you&#x27;ve got EVPs of the</p>
<time>00:39:20</time>
<p>voices. You&#x27;ve got, you&#x27;ve got</p>
<time>00:39:22</time>
<p>psychics claiming to be in</p>
<time>00:39:23</time>
<p>contact with her, claiming to</p>
<time>00:39:25</time>
<p>see her, claiming to have her</p>
<time>00:39:27</time>
<p>tell them the story. Right. The</p>
<time>00:39:30</time>
<p>original psychic claimed</p>
<time>00:39:31</time>
<p>Annette, Annette spirit told him</p>
<time>00:39:34</time>
<p>her terribly sad story. So</p>
<time>00:39:37</time>
<p>what&#x27;s going on? Right. Is it? I</p>
<time>00:39:39</time>
<p>don&#x27;t think everyone&#x27;s just</p>
<time>00:39:40</time>
<p>pretending. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:39:41</time>
<p>hallucinations. No, I never</p>
<time>00:39:43</time>
<p>liked that explanation either.</p>
<time>00:39:45</time>
<p>The hallucinations. Is it the</p>
<time>00:39:48</time>
<p>story has generated the</p>
<time>00:39:52</time>
<p>experiences that people see? Is</p>
<time>00:39:55</time>
<p>that possible? Is it that the</p>
<time>00:39:56</time>
<p>story of a young 17 year old</p>
<time>00:39:59</time>
<p>Annette Williamson with long</p>
<time>00:40:00</time>
<p>blonde hair, blue eyes that</p>
<time>00:40:01</time>
<p>haunts because of this story.</p>
<time>00:40:03</time>
<p>Did that generate a ghost that</p>
<time>00:40:06</time>
<p>people now see? What do you guys</p>
<time>00:40:08</time>
<p>think? I have two things when</p>
<time>00:40:09</time>
<p>they do the EVP or when the, I</p>
<time>00:40:12</time>
<p>guess when the, you know, you</p>
<time>00:40:14</time>
<p>can&#x27;t really know what the</p>
<time>00:40:15</time>
<p>psychics are hearing from the</p>
<time>00:40:16</time>
<p>spirits or whatever, I guess.</p>
<time>00:40:18</time>
<p>But when they say like, Oh, do</p>
<time>00:40:20</time>
<p>they say, Oh, Annette, are you</p>
<time>00:40:23</time>
<p>here? Like, do they specifically</p>
<time>00:40:24</time>
<p>say, okay. Because I&#x27;m gonna say</p>
<time>00:40:26</time>
<p>if they just say nothing related</p>
<time>00:40:28</time>
<p>to her name. Yep. No, it&#x27;s, it</p>
<time>00:40:31</time>
<p>is the address Annette. They</p>
<time>00:40:33</time>
<p>mentioned the story. I even</p>
<time>00:40:35</time>
<p>watched a YouTube video of some</p>
<time>00:40:36</time>
<p>kid from six years ago who would</p>
<time>00:40:40</time>
<p>go around long on with his</p>
<time>00:40:41</time>
<p>grandma who was psychic and he</p>
<time>00:40:43</time>
<p>would bring an EVP meter and go</p>
<time>00:40:45</time>
<p>into haunted places and go in</p>
<time>00:40:48</time>
<p>this place. He&#x27;d go, Annette,</p>
<time>00:40:49</time>
<p>are you there? His voice is kind</p>
<time>00:40:52</time>
<p>of funny. I feel bad for</p>
<time>00:40:53</time>
<p>laughing at him, but it&#x27;s very</p>
<time>00:40:54</time>
<p>funny. I&#x27;ll put it in the show</p>
<time>00:40:55</time>
<p>notes. Annette, are you there?</p>
<time>00:40:58</time>
<p>And then you hear like the thing</p>
<time>00:41:00</time>
<p>go off and he&#x27;s grandma,</p>
<time>00:41:01</time>
<p>grandma, grandma, come here.</p>
<time>00:41:02</time>
<p>It&#x27;s really weird. Grandma and</p>
<time>00:41:06</time>
<p>grandson, paranormal</p>
<time>00:41:08</time>
<p>investigating duo. And his dad</p>
<time>00:41:10</time>
<p>and his uncle are part of their</p>
<time>00:41:12</time>
<p>production. It&#x27;s pretty cool.</p>
<time>00:41:15</time>
<p>It&#x27;s a family business, but it</p>
<time>00:41:16</time>
<p>is the guy&#x27;s voice is funny.</p>
<time>00:41:17</time>
<p>What do you think? So one thing</p>
<time>00:41:20</time>
<p>that I was considering, which</p>
<time>00:41:22</time>
<p>still doesn&#x27;t completely make</p>
<time>00:41:24</time>
<p>the story lineup, perhaps</p>
<time>00:41:26</time>
<p>because the entire family was</p>
<time>00:41:29</time>
<p>killed and, you know, there was</p>
<time>00:41:32</time>
<p>no like next of kin to bury</p>
<time>00:41:34</time>
<p>them. Perhaps the British</p>
<time>00:41:36</time>
<p>soldiers just took them and</p>
<time>00:41:38</time>
<p>dumped them with other bodies or</p>
<time>00:41:40</time>
<p>oh wait, no, it was the</p>
<time>00:41:41</time>
<p>townspeople that killed them.</p>
<time>00:41:43</time>
<p>Wasn&#x27;t it? But maybe that works</p>
<time>00:41:45</time>
<p>though. Cause yeah, the story is</p>
<time>00:41:47</time>
<p>that they were so pissed at the</p>
<time>00:41:49</time>
<p>Williamson&#x27;s that they killed</p>
<time>00:41:50</time>
<p>them all. So maybe, yeah, maybe</p>
<time>00:41:51</time>
<p>they wouldn&#x27;t give them a proper</p>
<time>00:41:51</time>
<p>burial. Yeah. So, you know,</p>
<time>00:41:53</time>
<p>maybe they, their bodies and</p>
<time>00:41:56</time>
<p>therefore records have gone</p>
<time>00:41:57</time>
<p>unnoticed. What about the other</p>
<time>00:41:59</time>
<p>tombs though, that are</p>
<time>00:42:00</time>
<p>Williamson&#x27;s? Is that just like</p>
<time>00:42:02</time>
<p>a later branch of that family? I</p>
<time>00:42:04</time>
<p>mean, it&#x27;s, it&#x27;s not like an</p>
<time>00:42:06</time>
<p>unheard of name. That&#x27;s, yeah.</p>
<time>00:42:08</time>
<p>You know, and given that their</p>
<time>00:42:10</time>
<p>names are what would be John and</p>
<time>00:42:14</time>
<p>Hannah and William and William.</p>
<time>00:42:17</time>
<p>William Williamson. Well, you</p>
<time>00:42:20</time>
<p>got to start the last name</p>
<time>00:42:21</time>
<p>somewhere, but those all sound a</p>
<time>00:42:25</time>
<p>lot more English names. So</p>
<time>00:42:28</time>
<p>perhaps it&#x27;s just a coincidence</p>
<time>00:42:29</time>
<p>and there&#x27;s a different family</p>
<time>00:42:31</time>
<p>of Williamson&#x27;s. That&#x27;d be</p>
<time>00:42:33</time>
<p>interesting, but they&#x27;re also in</p>
<time>00:42:34</time>
<p>the same exact area at the same</p>
<time>00:42:36</time>
<p>time. It&#x27;s unlikely, but yeah,</p>
<time>00:42:39</time>
<p>it&#x27;s definitely possible. I</p>
<time>00:42:40</time>
<p>never, honestly, thinking about</p>
<time>00:42:41</time>
<p>like maybe the time period is</p>
<time>00:42:43</time>
<p>off or that those were two</p>
<time>00:42:45</time>
<p>theories that just never crossed</p>
<time>00:42:46</time>
<p>my mind when doing all this</p>
<time>00:42:47</time>
<p>research. I was like, this is</p>
<time>00:42:49</time>
<p>ridiculous. There&#x27;s no such</p>
<time>00:42:51</time>
<p>person. It&#x27;s, it&#x27;s a lie. But</p>
<time>00:42:54</time>
<p>no, there definitely are, who</p>
<time>00:42:56</time>
<p>knows, right? I think there&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:42:59</time>
<p>something or some things that</p>
<time>00:43:03</time>
<p>haunt the country house</p>
<time>00:43:04</time>
<p>restaurant in Stony Brook, New</p>
<time>00:43:07</time>
<p>York. I don&#x27;t know what the</p>
<time>00:43:16</time>
<p>mindset in Stony Brook is</p>
<time>00:43:29</time>
<p>looking for, but it doesn&#x27;t like</p>
<time>00:43:31</time>
<p>how it&#x27;s King and how long has</p>
<time>00:43:31</time>
<p>it gone apart. And so that&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:43:36</time>
<p>Liam Simon thanks for joining on</p>
<time>00:43:37</time>
<p>this episode The PHONE KID It&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:44:11</time>
<p>popular enough in Long Island</p>
<time>00:44:12</time>
<p>and enough people believe it and</p>
<time>00:44:17</time>
<p>give a lot of credence to it and</p>
<time>00:44:19</time>
<p>think about it while they&#x27;re</p>
<time>00:44:20</time>
<p>there. Those thoughts being so</p>
<time>00:44:23</time>
<p>concentrated on that could</p>
<time>00:44:25</time>
<p>create like a topic entity and</p>
<time>00:44:30</time>
<p>it&#x27;s manifesting as this Annette</p>
<time>00:44:32</time>
<p>Williamson that really isn&#x27;t</p>
<time>00:44:34</time>
<p>there. And that lines up with</p>
<time>00:44:37</time>
<p>there not being any records or</p>
<time>00:44:39</time>
<p>anything like that. Then where</p>
<time>00:44:42</time>
<p>do you think the original story</p>
<time>00:44:44</time>
<p>do you think that French psychic</p>
<time>00:44:46</time>
<p>was just like yeah I want a free</p>
<time>00:44:48</time>
<p>meal let me just there&#x27;s a</p>
<time>00:44:50</time>
<p>spirit here. Annette Williamson</p>
<time>00:44:53</time>
<p>let me let me tell you the tale</p>
<time>00:44:54</time>
<p>over a dinner. You think you</p>
<time>00:44:56</time>
<p>just made up a story and Annette</p>
<time>00:44:58</time>
<p>we don&#x27;t know anything about</p>
<time>00:44:59</time>
<p>that. We don&#x27;t know anything</p>
<time>00:45:00</time>
<p>about the French psych. Yeah I</p>
<time>00:45:02</time>
<p>got to find we got to find that</p>
<time>00:45:03</time>
<p>guy. Yeah or we got to find</p>
<time>00:45:05</time>
<p>Annette. Yeah. Oh I would love</p>
<time>00:45:08</time>
<p>to go and evidently people just</p>
<time>00:45:09</time>
<p>show up or talk to the guy and</p>
<time>00:45:11</time>
<p>he lets them like do paranormal</p>
<time>00:45:12</time>
<p>investigations like the owner is</p>
<time>00:45:13</time>
<p>very obviously it&#x27;s like a great</p>
<time>00:45:15</time>
<p>marketing thing right. He&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:45:16</time>
<p>really into it. Also he really</p>
<time>00:45:18</time>
<p>people are people are</p>
<time>00:45:20</time>
<p>experiencing things like we&#x27;ve</p>
<time>00:45:21</time>
<p>been saying something&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:45:23</time>
<p>happening. Oh yeah there is it</p>
<time>00:45:24</time>
<p>there&#x27;s stuff there. It&#x27;s if</p>
<time>00:45:26</time>
<p>it&#x27;s a Topa that&#x27;s people have</p>
<time>00:45:28</time>
<p>thought because people thought</p>
<time>00:45:29</time>
<p>it&#x27;s Annette and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:45:30</time>
<p>happening then sure but if it&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:45:37</time>
<p>not and there&#x27;s something else</p>
<time>00:45:38</time>
<p>at play maybe again there could</p>
<time>00:45:40</time>
<p>be there are plenty of</p>
<time>00:45:42</time>
<p>undocumented deaths that happen</p>
<time>00:45:44</time>
<p>and I&#x27;m sure back then it was</p>
<time>00:45:45</time>
<p>probably more common. Not saying</p>
<time>00:45:47</time>
<p>no records were taken. It wasn&#x27;t</p>
<time>00:45:50</time>
<p>that long ago but could be an</p>
<time>00:45:53</time>
<p>undocumented death and it&#x27;s just</p>
<time>00:45:55</time>
<p>matching the same description.</p>
<time>00:45:58</time>
<p>The Annette thing could have</p>
<time>00:46:00</time>
<p>just been made up. Who knows</p>
<time>00:46:02</time>
<p>like the actual name like it</p>
<time>00:46:06</time>
<p>could be like a person could</p>
<time>00:46:08</time>
<p>still have died there but maybe</p>
<time>00:46:10</time>
<p>her name wasn&#x27;t Annette. That&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:46:12</time>
<p>true. Well final thoughts Aaron.</p>
<time>00:46:15</time>
<p>When are we going down to this</p>
<time>00:46:16</time>
<p>restaurant. It&#x27;s my final</p>
<time>00:46:18</time>
<p>thoughts. Give me let&#x27;s let&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:46:21</time>
<p>say a few months. I will go I</p>
<time>00:46:23</time>
<p>will call I&#x27;ll say Bob. Bob you</p>
<time>00:46:26</time>
<p>lying to me. Let me see. Show me</p>
<time>00:46:30</time>
<p>the grave Bob. Show me Annette</p>
<time>00:46:32</time>
<p>Williamson. It&#x27;s in your</p>
<time>00:46:34</time>
<p>backyard. You know I would love</p>
<time>00:46:38</time>
<p>to get to buy on that. It&#x27;s also</p>
<time>00:46:39</time>
<p>weird that there&#x27;s kind of aside</p>
<time>00:46:41</time>
<p>from the story that this is</p>
<time>00:46:43</time>
<p>what&#x27;s called Long Island&#x27;s you</p>
<time>00:46:45</time>
<p>know quote most haunted location</p>
<time>00:46:47</time>
<p>when there&#x27;s all those stories</p>
<time>00:46:50</time>
<p>and conspiracy theories of what</p>
<time>00:46:51</time>
<p>happened out on like Montauk.</p>
<time>00:46:55</time>
<p>That&#x27;s like why those are gonna</p>
<time>00:46:57</time>
<p>be great stories for another</p>
<time>00:46:58</time>
<p>time. Like why like when I think</p>
<time>00:47:00</time>
<p>of like you know spooky things</p>
<time>00:47:03</time>
<p>or just weird things in Long</p>
<time>00:47:04</time>
<p>Island I think of Montauk. I</p>
<time>00:47:07</time>
<p>don&#x27;t think of this restaurant</p>
<time>00:47:09</time>
<p>in Stony Brook. We&#x27;ll have to</p>
<time>00:47:12</time>
<p>record another episode on that.</p>
<time>00:47:14</time>
<p>Yeah you&#x27;re right I think maybe</p>
<time>00:47:16</time>
<p>this is um it&#x27;s very accessible.</p>
<time>00:47:19</time>
<p>I guess. Yeah it&#x27;s like right</p>
<time>00:47:21</time>
<p>you can tell us the kids you</p>
<time>00:47:22</time>
<p>tell it to uh to adults. It&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:47:24</time>
<p>yeah it&#x27;s like something that</p>
<time>00:47:26</time>
<p>right we&#x27;re not saying like</p>
<time>00:47:27</time>
<p>Bigfoot lives in shore on the</p>
<time>00:47:29</time>
<p>New York. He might you don&#x27;t</p>
<time>00:47:32</time>
<p>know. Oh he might. There&#x27;s not</p>
<time>00:47:34</time>
<p>enough people in the summer</p>
<time>00:47:35</time>
<p>home. In those artificial woods</p>
<time>00:47:38</time>
<p>down on Long Island. Bigfoot in</p>
<time>00:47:40</time>
<p>the Hamptons. That sounds like a</p>
<time>00:47:42</time>
<p>movie or a book or something.</p>
<time>00:47:43</time>
<p>Sounds like yeah I think maybe</p>
<time>00:47:50</time>
<p>that&#x27;s you know it&#x27;s easy to</p>
<time>00:47:52</time>
<p>market. It&#x27;s like a great</p>
<time>00:47:54</time>
<p>touristy thing too. But yeah</p>
<time>00:47:57</time>
<p>something&#x27;s going on there. I</p>
<time>00:47:59</time>
<p>think it&#x27;d be great if we had a</p>
<time>00:48:01</time>
<p>nice dinner there and uh kept an</p>
<time>00:48:03</time>
<p>eye out for her. And Annette</p>
<time>00:48:04</time>
<p>threw a knife at you. Okay</p>
<time>00:48:06</time>
<p>butter knife. Maybe just like</p>
<time>00:48:09</time>
<p>change the channel on the radio.</p>
<time>00:48:11</time>
<p>That&#x27;s good. Change the channel.</p>
<time>00:48:12</time>
<p>The craziest claim I heard from</p>
<time>00:48:14</time>
<p>Joe the media psychic or</p>
<time>00:48:17</time>
<p>whatever was that he has EVPs</p>
<time>00:48:19</time>
<p>where you hear the background</p>
<time>00:48:21</time>
<p>music of the restaurant playing.</p>
<time>00:48:23</time>
<p>And it will cut from that to the</p>
<time>00:48:26</time>
<p>voice of a young woman singing.</p>
<time>00:48:29</time>
<p>Just no music at all just her</p>
<time>00:48:31</time>
<p>singing. I don&#x27;t know what he</p>
<time>00:48:33</time>
<p>meant. Oh good. I never one</p>
<time>00:48:36</time>
<p>thing couldn&#x27;t find recordings.</p>
<time>00:48:38</time>
<p>Like a personal thing for me</p>
<time>00:48:39</time>
<p>EVPs always are so shaky for me.</p>
<time>00:48:43</time>
<p>Like all the audio evidence that</p>
<time>00:48:45</time>
<p>like you know plenty of the</p>
<time>00:48:46</time>
<p>ghost shows do and like even on</p>
<time>00:48:49</time>
<p>like I love like the BuzzFeed</p>
<time>00:48:51</time>
<p>unsolved guys what they what</p>
<time>00:48:53</time>
<p>they did. Yeah like but they</p>
<time>00:48:54</time>
<p>still do like the EVP things. I</p>
<time>00:48:56</time>
<p>never really liked that you know</p>
<time>00:48:57</time>
<p>and I you know I believe in</p>
<time>00:49:00</time>
<p>ghosts and that a lot of people</p>
<time>00:49:01</time>
<p>experience a lot of weird</p>
<time>00:49:02</time>
<p>things. I have friends that have</p>
<time>00:49:03</time>
<p>experienced things but like</p>
<time>00:49:05</time>
<p>those audio recording things I</p>
<time>00:49:06</time>
<p>don&#x27;t put a lot of a lot of</p>
<time>00:49:08</time>
<p>credence into what those give.</p>
<time>00:49:10</time>
<p>So I&#x27;m always hesitant when</p>
<time>00:49:12</time>
<p>someone says oh look at the CVP</p>
<time>00:49:13</time>
<p>because even like you said it</p>
<time>00:49:15</time>
<p>said oh come. Ah yes one. Yeah</p>
<time>00:49:17</time>
<p>those are the ones that are</p>
<time>00:49:18</time>
<p>those that&#x27;s just such the</p>
<time>00:49:20</time>
<p>classic EVP. I&#x27;ll put them in</p>
<time>00:49:21</time>
<p>the astronauts. Where you get</p>
<time>00:49:23</time>
<p>one word. It may be two. You</p>
<time>00:49:27</time>
<p>never get full sentences but the</p>
<time>00:49:30</time>
<p>full sentences you get might</p>
<time>00:49:31</time>
<p>come from like psychics but then</p>
<time>00:49:34</time>
<p>now you have to put all your</p>
<time>00:49:35</time>
<p>belief in this one person and</p>
<time>00:49:37</time>
<p>apparently at least with these</p>
<time>00:49:39</time>
<p>psychics they just missed the</p>
<time>00:49:40</time>
<p>mark. Yeah that makes you wonder</p>
<time>00:49:41</time>
<p>like are they just picking up on</p>
<time>00:49:43</time>
<p>that like you said Nick like</p>
<time>00:49:45</time>
<p>that thought form that&#x27;s out</p>
<time>00:49:46</time>
<p>there like are they just picking</p>
<time>00:49:49</time>
<p>up on what&#x27;s around. It&#x27;s not</p>
<time>00:49:52</time>
<p>necessarily weird. True. Like if</p>
<time>00:49:54</time>
<p>you like okay so say like that</p>
<time>00:49:57</time>
<p>you know they can contact the</p>
<time>00:49:59</time>
<p>dead like psychics or mediums.</p>
<time>00:50:01</time>
<p>It&#x27;d be weird for them to be</p>
<time>00:50:03</time>
<p>able to be in contact with</p>
<time>00:50:04</time>
<p>something that&#x27;s not dead. It&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:50:07</time>
<p>you know it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a if it is</p>
<time>00:50:09</time>
<p>like a tulp idea that&#x27;s just</p>
<time>00:50:11</time>
<p>like energy from people&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:50:13</time>
<p>thoughts. You think so? I think</p>
<time>00:50:15</time>
<p>I mean unless it I mean you can</p>
<time>00:50:17</time>
<p>go into all this kind of</p>
<time>00:50:19</time>
<p>different how you know energies</p>
<time>00:50:20</time>
<p>work and. Aaron should tell us</p>
<time>00:50:24</time>
<p>as the electrical engineer how</p>
<time>00:50:26</time>
<p>energy works. How energy works.</p>
<time>00:50:29</time>
<p>You want to lose viewers with</p>
<time>00:50:30</time>
<p>that one? Which is like it&#x27;d be</p>
<time>00:50:34</time>
<p>it&#x27;s weird to think that like me</p>
<time>00:50:36</time>
<p>like people that say they&#x27;re</p>
<time>00:50:37</time>
<p>mediums that&#x27;s the connotation</p>
<time>00:50:38</time>
<p>that they talk to the dead. If</p>
<time>00:50:40</time>
<p>it&#x27;s a tulpa that&#x27;s not a dead</p>
<time>00:50:42</time>
<p>thing. It&#x27;s the idea of a dead</p>
<time>00:50:43</time>
<p>thing. That&#x27;s it. I guess not</p>
<time>00:50:45</time>
<p>the person but. I understand</p>
<time>00:50:47</time>
<p>what you&#x27;re saying. So you&#x27;re</p>
<time>00:50:48</time>
<p>saying if mediums can do what</p>
<time>00:50:50</time>
<p>they claim they would really</p>
<time>00:50:51</time>
<p>only be communicating with dead</p>
<time>00:50:53</time>
<p>spirits not with other you know</p>
<time>00:50:55</time>
<p>quote made up spirits because</p>
<time>00:50:57</time>
<p>it&#x27;s again there&#x27;s a lot of</p>
<time>00:50:59</time>
<p>energy that goes into like this</p>
<time>00:51:01</time>
<p>creation of a tulpa like you</p>
<time>00:51:03</time>
<p>know the Tibetan monks where</p>
<time>00:51:05</time>
<p>this started you know monks you</p>
<time>00:51:06</time>
<p>know they live a very solitary</p>
<time>00:51:08</time>
<p>life but they can be very</p>
<time>00:51:10</time>
<p>focused. So they put a lot of</p>
<time>00:51:13</time>
<p>thought into whatever entity</p>
<time>00:51:16</time>
<p>they want to create and then</p>
<time>00:51:17</time>
<p>they create that tulpa. So like</p>
<time>00:51:19</time>
<p>like I said if a lot of people</p>
<time>00:51:20</time>
<p>are doing that maybe not a lot</p>
<time>00:51:22</time>
<p>of thought but if a lot of</p>
<time>00:51:23</time>
<p>people are putting some thought</p>
<time>00:51:24</time>
<p>into it it&#x27;s still just this</p>
<time>00:51:25</time>
<p>build up of you know thought</p>
<time>00:51:29</time>
<p>energy. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s the equivalent</p>
<time>00:51:31</time>
<p>of a spiritual think tank but</p>
<time>00:51:35</time>
<p>just instead of. Did you have</p>
<time>00:51:36</time>
<p>that written down? No I did not.</p>
<time>00:51:40</time>
<p>It was like you know a lot of</p>
<time>00:51:41</time>
<p>people are just thinking about</p>
<time>00:51:42</time>
<p>it. It&#x27;d be weird that psychics</p>
<time>00:51:44</time>
<p>could pick up on like thought</p>
<time>00:51:48</time>
<p>forms rather than spirits</p>
<time>00:51:50</time>
<p>because then that makes you</p>
<time>00:51:51</time>
<p>wonder for all these like</p>
<time>00:51:53</time>
<p>classic haunted places even down</p>
<time>00:51:55</time>
<p>there like Amityville and all</p>
<time>00:51:56</time>
<p>that the psychics that go there</p>
<time>00:51:58</time>
<p>are they picking up on spirits</p>
<time>00:52:00</time>
<p>or on tulpas if because if a lot</p>
<time>00:52:04</time>
<p>of people are thinking about</p>
<time>00:52:05</time>
<p>things and you believe in that</p>
<time>00:52:06</time>
<p>idea of a tulpa it&#x27;s not</p>
<time>00:52:08</time>
<p>entirely out of the realm of</p>
<time>00:52:09</time>
<p>possibility that that&#x27;s what it</p>
<time>00:52:11</time>
<p>is and there aren&#x27;t actually</p>
<time>00:52:12</time>
<p>any. That&#x27;s interesting. Yeah I</p>
<time>00:52:15</time>
<p>they came they both came across</p>
<time>00:52:18</time>
<p>as very sincere and very</p>
<time>00:52:20</time>
<p>confident but some of the things</p>
<time>00:52:22</time>
<p>that they said were just</p>
<time>00:52:23</time>
<p>factually wrong so it makes you</p>
<time>00:52:25</time>
<p>wonder right it really makes you</p>
<time>00:52:27</time>
<p>wonder I think that there&#x27;s</p>
<time>00:52:29</time>
<p>still enough questions that are</p>
<time>00:52:30</time>
<p>left unanswered here. I&#x27;m gonna</p>
<time>00:52:32</time>
<p>keep digging a little bit and</p>
<time>00:52:34</time>
<p>maybe we&#x27;ll report back one day</p>
<time>00:52:36</time>
<p>but I think it would be great to</p>
<time>00:52:37</time>
<p>visit see if we expensive meal</p>
<time>00:52:42</time>
<p>hopefully it&#x27;d be good. Maybe if</p>
<time>00:52:45</time>
<p>we&#x27;re nice we could visit the</p>
<time>00:52:47</time>
<p>cemetery if we say if we</p>
<time>00:52:49</time>
<p>impersonate FBI agents as Nick</p>
<time>00:52:51</time>
<p>says. I&#x27;m telling you it&#x27;s a</p>
<time>00:52:52</time>
<p>surefire way for illegal</p>
<time>00:52:55</time>
<p>purposes that&#x27;s a joke. Yeah yes</p>
<time>00:52:59</time>
<p>wink. That&#x27;s the story of</p>
<time>00:53:04</time>
<p>Annette Williamson and I have to</p>
<time>00:53:07</time>
<p>say it made me wonder that the</p>
<time>00:53:09</time>
<p>very first story I decided to</p>
<time>00:53:12</time>
<p>research and tell was such a</p>
<time>00:53:14</time>
<p>well-known story in Long Island</p>
<time>00:53:16</time>
<p>that also proved to be on very</p>
<time>00:53:22</time>
<p>shaky historical ground. Really</p>
<time>00:53:25</time>
<p>makes you think. So I&#x27;m very</p>
<time>00:53:27</time>
<p>curious to see in the things I</p>
<time>00:53:29</time>
<p>research next I&#x27;m gonna be</p>
<time>00:53:30</time>
<p>looking more at things in the</p>
<time>00:53:31</time>
<p>Bronx in my hometown and also</p>
<time>00:53:33</time>
<p>Long Island stuff because</p>
<time>00:53:34</time>
<p>there&#x27;s just a lot of history</p>
<time>00:53:35</time>
<p>there. Is that going to be a</p>
<time>00:53:36</time>
<p>common theme or is this an</p>
<time>00:53:37</time>
<p>outlier? So tune in to the next</p>
<time>00:53:42</time>
<p>episodes looking forward to what</p>
<time>00:53:44</time>
<p>you guys have in store.</p>
<time>00:53:45</time>
<p>Hopefully there&#x27;s less deception</p>
<time>00:53:47</time>
<p>by psychics and mediums. And</p>
<time>00:53:49</time>
<p>what I have coming up from what</p>
<time>00:53:52</time>
<p>I&#x27;ve done there are no psychics</p>
<time>00:53:53</time>
<p>involved. It&#x27;s more the</p>
<time>00:53:55</time>
<p>retelling of others accounts of</p>
<time>00:53:59</time>
<p>a very large cemetery right in</p>

<time>00:54:26</time>
