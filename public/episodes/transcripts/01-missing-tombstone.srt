00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:21,339
Tonight on our very

2
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:22,820
first episode, we're talking

3
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,140
about one of Long Island New

4
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,039
York's most haunted places with

5
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,100
over three centuries of history,

6
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:30,280
the Country House Restaurant in

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,359
Stony Brook. We'll hear the sad

8
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:33,719
story of Annette Williamson's

9
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:35,100
death and search the Obadiah

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,899
Davis Cemetery to find out who

11
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:38,060
really has been haunting the

12
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,600
property and spooking owners,

13
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:41,439
workers, and patrons alike over

14
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:42,939
the years, and along the way

15
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:44,000
we'll learn to never trust

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,619
French psychics. It's Wednesday

17
00:00:46,619 --> 00:01:01,859
at 9pm. Okay guys, I have a

18
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:03,840
great story to start the show

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,060
off. Over the weekend, I was

20
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,799
visiting family for my grandma's

21
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,659
birthday and my Uncle Joe from

22
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,260
Long Island mentioned that

23
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,500
there's a billion haunted places

24
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,159
on Long Island. We love Uncle

25
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:17,099
Joe. We do. He's great, but he

26
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:17,920
pointed me in the direction of

27
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,340
some stories what's considered

28
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,840
the most haunted location on

29
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,260
Long Island. It's called the

30
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,959
Country House Restaurant and I

31
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,140
want to tell you guys a story

32
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,659
about the ghosts that haunted

33
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,739
and why the story that's told

34
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:31,120
might not be true. Oh,

35
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,640
scandalous. Yeah, I like stories

36
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,959
with different perspectives.

37
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:42,739
Yeah, I bet you do. Okay, so

38
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:44,319
actually we might have passed by

39
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,719
this actually when we went on

40
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:47,060
our trip to Long Island over the

41
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,219
summer. It's in Stony Brook. We

42
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:51,340
were in Lake the Hamptons. Sauer

43
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,760
is pretty far out east way past

44
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,239
this, but we might have driven

45
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,519
right past this road, right past

46
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,299
this restaurant. For those who

47
00:01:58,299 --> 00:01:59,299
don't know Long Island, it's on

48
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:00,719
the north shore of Long Island,

49
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,340
which is the huge island to the

50
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,500
east of New York City. It's not

51
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,280
part of New York City, but two

52
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,860
boroughs of New York City,

53
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:12,080
Brooklyn and Queens, are on the

54
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,039
island, but they don't really

55
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,199
consider it Long Island. People

56
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,259
would be very offended if you

57
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:16,780
said you were from Long Island

58
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,400
if you're from Queens or

59
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,699
Brooklyn. So do you guys know

60
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:21,919
how old European settlements on

61
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,039
Long Island are? If you had to

62
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,500
give a random guess? Well, 400

63
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,379
years. Okay, I thought you guys

64
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:30,759
can be wrong. That's right. It's

65
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:33,060
like 300 years old since the 16,

66
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,300
that's almost 400, honestly,

67
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:38,340
1600s, mid 1600s. Right. The

68
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,159
water above it, the Long Island

69
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:41,840
Sound is where everyone would do

70
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,919
like whaling, killing whales and

71
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:45,759
taking their meat and selling

72
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:46,819
them whatever. It was like

73
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:48,439
really nice water for that. So

74
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,419
it became really popular early

75
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,979
1600s. So a lot of the buildings

76
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:53,020
there are hundreds of hundreds

77
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,800
of years old. The building we're

78
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,099
talking about today was built in

79
00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:01,340
1710. Oh, yeah. So pre-America.

80
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,919
Yeah, pre-America, basically

81
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:04,800
what happened, a lot of New

82
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,259
England settlers came down to

83
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:10,099
Long Island mid 1600s for the

84
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:11,680
farming and for the whaling.

85
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:14,360
This is like prime time for a

86
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:14,960
few different things,

87
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,759
Freemasonry, secret societies,

88
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,960
and a little bit later on,

89
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:23,340
spiritualism. So I think Nick

90
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,099
and I really know about

91
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:25,539
spiritualism. Aaron, what do you

92
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,960
know about spiritualism? I'll be

93
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,620
honest, not that much. That's

94
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,960
really the idea simply that you

95
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,680
can talk to the dead. Oh, okay.

96
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,979
That's where mediums, the idea

97
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:36,780
of mediumship started. Sances

98
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,400
and all kinds of things like

99
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,439
that. In America, at least, it

100
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,300
started sweeping the nation in

101
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,139
like late 1700s and mid, all the

102
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:48,740
way through the 1800s. And it

103
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,479
became really popular for people

104
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,060
to do sÃ©ances and just shut the

105
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,439
lights off and use Ouija boards

106
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,539
and the precursors to Ouija

107
00:03:57,539 --> 00:03:59,780
boards and do table tipping and

108
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,719
all that. And mediums started

109
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:02,719
appearing claiming that they

110
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:03,900
could talk to the dead and you

111
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,939
can pay them and they'll talk to

112
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:07,020
your grandma and they'll

113
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,280
manifest your dog that died and

114
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,699
it'll lick your face in the dark

115
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:12,860
and stuff like that. It was kind

116
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,919
of like parlor games more to an

117
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:17,920
extent. It's a form of

118
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,839
entertainment more than

119
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,519
anything. Yeah. And

120
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,819
interestingly, this all really

121
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:23,019
started in like upstate New

122
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:24,500
York, not too far from where we

123
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,800
are right now in Heidsville,

124
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:29,480
which is like in between

125
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:34,420
Syracuse and Rochester. Oh, it's

126
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,439
more western than central. Yeah,

127
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,740
it's actually really west. Yeah.

128
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:40,060
Yeah. So this building built

129
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,220
around 1710 by the Davis family

130
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,060
and they owned it at least four

131
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,379
generations, pretty long time.

132
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,339
And again, this is on the North

133
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:49,339
Shore of Long Island, pretty

134
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:51,120
good farmland, but Stony Brook

135
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,220
really wasn't a well-known

136
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,120
place. It was kind of like

137
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,560
backwater town for the first

138
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,060
good chunk of it because no one

139
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,000
really wanted to go there. It

140
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,540
was difficult to travel there. A

141
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,279
bunch of poor farmers. No one

142
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,959
really cared. This building, the

143
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:03,819
Davis family must have been

144
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:05,139
pretty rich because it was huge,

145
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:06,899
very large building, two stories

146
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:09,319
and pretty active throughout the

147
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,920
1700s. It housed British

148
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,319
soldiers at some point. It was

149
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,360
used as a town meeting place, as

150
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,000
a stagecoach stop. During the

151
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,819
Revolutionary War, it was used

152
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:19,680
as a contact point for the

153
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,420
Culper Spy Ring, which was an

154
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,740
American spy ring that George

155
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,959
Washington started. There would

156
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,399
be spies that came in and out.

157
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:30,759
So imagine there's this

158
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:31,819
beautiful, and if you guys want

159
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:33,279
to click the link I sent you in

160
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,300
the Discord, which will be in

161
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,300
the show notes, you could see

162
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,620
this building. It's a restaurant

163
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,759
now. It was only a restaurant

164
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,480
starting in like 1970, 1980.

165
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,040
That's fairly recent for me

166
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,560
being, was it just a historical?

167
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,980
Oh, yeah, it was purchased

168
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,839
historical building for all that

169
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:49,779
time. Passed down through a few

170
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:51,800
different families. Yeah. And

171
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,759
it's right off, it's on the

172
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:53,939
corner of two main roads, Main

173
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:56,939
Street and like Route 25A, which

174
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,360
is that classic long road that

175
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,740
all Long Islanders know on the

176
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,379
North Shore. So yeah, a lot of

177
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:02,540
history here. Let's talk about

178
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,800
some of the weird stuff, right?

179
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,160
Because there's a lot here.

180
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:07,079
Imagine this nice house. It's

181
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,339
kind of on the hill. The Davis

182
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:10,220
family, Obadiah Davis was the

183
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,480
guy who bought it, bought the

184
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,800
land and built the property. He

185
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,339
built a family cemetery right

186
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:16,019
behind it on a little hill

187
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:17,459
overlooking the building. It's

188
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:18,500
where his family was buried.

189
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,939
That's still there to that day,

190
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,959
the cemetery. Do you think the

191
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,319
cemetery being there might

192
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,060
contribute to some of the

193
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,500
happenings that you're going to

194
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,000
discuss today? The cemetery does

195
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,100
feature very strongly in the

196
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,180
story. In fact, I found who's

197
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,199
buried in that cemetery, because

198
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,939
there are some conflicting

199
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,620
stories about the ghosts that

200
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,019
want this place and who's buried

201
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:45,279
here. I found the gravestones

202
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,139
and pictures of the gravestones

203
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:52,120
and some things don't line up. I

204
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,620
couldn't find where the cemetery

205
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,000
was actually, like physically on

206
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,180
Google maps or on maps. There's

207
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:58,800
no record of it. You probably

208
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,319
want to keep it. I actually

209
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,879
called them up today. Oh, wow.

210
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,040
No, I called them up today on

211
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,279
the phone. And I said, hi guys,

212
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,939
where's the Obadiah Davis

213
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:08,920
cemetery? And they told me,

214
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:09,660
they're like, oh, it's right

215
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,100
behind the stables next to the

216
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,500
parking lot. Oh, that's more

217
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,540
open of them than I would

218
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,819
expect. Yeah, I was like, oh,

219
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,860
oh, OK. Though from what I've

220
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,100
heard from all the research I

221
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,300
did, you can't just really, they

222
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,540
don't really appreciate you just

223
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,600
walking there. It's a very small

224
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,620
cemetery. It's like 50 tombs,

225
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,519
basically. It's kind of how it

226
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,779
goes from most cemeteries,

227
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,779
though, unless you have like

228
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:30,860
family there, you can't just

229
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,920
wander about. Yeah, it's not

230
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,040
like a public cemetery that

231
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,300
anyone can just to visit or even

232
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,839
be buried in. They're all very

233
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:41,500
old, like all 17, 1800 deaths.

234
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,040
So, yeah, so what do people

235
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,600
think about this house? Well, in

236
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,980
the 1800s, there was a very

237
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,879
famous comedian named Thomas

238
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:51,459
Hathaway. He purchased the house

239
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:53,040
and lived there for a while and

240
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,360
he was a spiritualist. So what

241
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,540
did he do? Well, he started

242
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,959
hosting seances in this

243
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:01,339
building, right? For all the

244
00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:03,160
neighborhood, all the people who

245
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,439
knew about this. It was more

246
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:06,019
actually a low key thing. He and

247
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:08,699
his close confidants would come

248
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:10,240
and perform seances and try to

249
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,300
do table tipping, which is

250
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,279
literally just putting your

251
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,800
hands on the table in the dark

252
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,560
and seeing if it starts tipping.

253
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:18,899
So it's kind of similar to when

254
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:21,300
people like grab the Ouija board

255
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,439
and push the little device onto

256
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,459
the letter they want. Depends.

257
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:30,000
Yeah, I mean, it depends on what

258
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,379
you think with it, how much

259
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,179
spirits we actually want. I just

260
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,200
want to like shake a table

261
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,240
around and stuff. Yeah, I think

262
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,080
it's a little silly. A lot of it

263
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,659
was revealed to be fraud at the

264
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:43,220
time. In fact, one of Thomas

265
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,220
Hathaway's buddies was a guy

266
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,519
named William Sidney Mount, who

267
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:48,100
was a pretty famous artist of

268
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,080
the time. And this guy was like

269
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,039
hardcore freemason and a

270
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:55,200
hardcore spiritualist. And he

271
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,679
would come to these seances and

272
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,980
perform these seances all the

273
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,460
time. He lived across the street

274
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,759
basically in his own haunted

275
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:05,419
house. And this guy, William

276
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,139
Sidney Mount, is supposedly one

277
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:09,460
of the ghosts that still haunts

278
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,100
the country house restaurant to

279
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,379
this day. It's said that he

280
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:15,500
comes back to perform seances

281
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:21,820
like he used to that he shows up

282
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,100
in his, it said he shows up in

283
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,240
his like his travel gear with

284
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,340
his big hat and like his long

285
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,460
jacket and stuff, the same dress

286
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,320
he would use to come to the

287
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,480
seances. He just keeps

288
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,440
contacting himself. He just

289
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,899
keeps contacting himself, I

290
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:39,299
guess. Yeah. It's a very vicious

291
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:41,159
cycle. A lot of famous people

292
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,340
would do seances here. The other

293
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,580
guy that I found interesting was

294
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,740
P.T. Barnum of the fame,

295
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,279
obviously like entertainer fame

296
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,960
of circus fame. He was a buddy

297
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,779
of Hathaway because Hathaway

298
00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:55,539
actually worked for him as a

299
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:57,320
performer. So you had lots of

300
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,120
interesting people, interesting

301
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,600
beliefs, hosting seances, trying

302
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,019
to contact the dead, often

303
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,639
trying to contact their own dead

304
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:06,899
loved ones, claiming to

305
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:08,299
experience different things,

306
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,899
claiming to see things. And that

307
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:12,940
was for a short time in the mid

308
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,600
to late 1800s. Many of the

309
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,000
owners of this place have had

310
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,500
some interest in the occult or

311
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,419
spirits or something really

312
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:23,539
anything like that. So given

313
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:26,639
that, nowadays a lot is said

314
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:29,000
about this place. The current

315
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,960
owner who purchased it in I

316
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,279
think like 2005, Bob

317
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:36,700
Willemstein, he used to work

318
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,039
there as a busboy like 20 years

319
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,259
before and he worked his way all

320
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:42,679
the way up to owner eventually,

321
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,519
which is pretty cool. Pretty

322
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,679
impressive. And there are many

323
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,320
interviews with him where he

324
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,360
tells all the stories of all the

325
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,480
crazy things that happen to him,

326
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:55,960
that happened to his workers,

327
00:10:56,379 --> 00:10:57,500
that happened to visitors, that

328
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,200
happened to guests. Right?

329
00:10:59,259 --> 00:10:59,919
Because this is a restaurant

330
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:04,519
that we can go to. In fact, I

331
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:05,519
know someone who's gone to it.

332
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,799
My girlfriend Sarah has eaten

333
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,620
there as a kid, but supposedly

334
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,840
it's very fine dining. It's very

335
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,259
expensive. It's like 20 to $40 a

336
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:13,980
meal. But anyway, some of the

337
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,840
stuff that's said to happen

338
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,039
here, and this is considered

339
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,179
Long Island's most haunted

340
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:22,220
place. So people are said to

341
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,600
have seen the ghost of William

342
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,580
Sidney Mount. So a man dressed

343
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,840
in 1800s garb walking in the

344
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,860
hallways, leaving footsteps,

345
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,820
workers at night locking up

346
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,700
would see him at the corner of

347
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,259
their eyes. It's always like the

348
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:37,580
same description of the guy,

349
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,139
right? A lot of different things

350
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:40,019
with him, a lot of different

351
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:42,940
things with other male spirits

352
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,700
and, you know, EVP. So

353
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,500
recordings of disembodied voices

354
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,919
and all that, things like

355
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:52,539
candles being reignited. But the

356
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:54,639
most interesting story that

357
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,080
comes out of the country house

358
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,500
haunting is that of Annette

359
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,220
Williamson. So I'm gonna tell

360
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,100
you guys the story of Annette

361
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,919
Williamson. And then we're gonna

362
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:04,779
see if there's anything funky

363
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:06,600
about the story. So this story

364
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:12,620
comes from the owner, Bob, who

365
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,820
was told it by a random French

366
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,299
psychic who once visited the

367
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:21,840
restaurant years and years ago.

368
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,039
Like when he was the owner or

369
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:26,299
when he was a busboy? When he

370
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:27,639
was the owner, this random

371
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:29,139
French psychic showed up in town

372
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:31,200
late one night and was like, oh,

373
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:32,919
you're there, Auguste in your

374
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,360
house. That's my French accent.

375
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,039
It's pretty good. And Bob was

376
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:37,659
like, oh, tell me about it. And

377
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:39,419
he sat and he told this whole

378
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:41,879
story. Then Long Island's most

379
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:45,460
famous psychic duo, a lady named

380
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,240
Carrie Anne, now Long Island

381
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,759
Medium, Carrie Anne and Joe

382
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:53,299
Giaquinto is the guy. He's a

383
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:54,580
paranormal investigator and he

384
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,820
considers himself a medium kind

385
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,879
of sensitive sort of. Yeah, he

386
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:00,980
considers himself that's a good

387
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,559
way to put it, sensitive. They

388
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:05,419
have written books. They've

389
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:06,399
written many stories about this

390
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,419
because they claim to be in

391
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:08,860
contact with the ghost of

392
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,100
Annette Williamson. And they

393
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,440
verified her story and expanded

394
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,019
on it and documented it in books

395
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:18,779
and documentaries and local news

396
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:20,200
articles to the point where it's

397
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,419
one of the most famous Long

398
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:23,340
Island haunted haunting stories.

399
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,700
So who is Annette Williamson?

400
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,360
Well, it's said that the

401
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,259
Williamson family was a family

402
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:31,539
that owned the property at some

403
00:13:31,539 --> 00:13:32,960
point during the Revolutionary

404
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,799
War, that period, right? And

405
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:35,580
it's that they had several

406
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,220
children, the oldest of which

407
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:40,100
was Annette. She was only 17

408
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,019
years old, so the rest of the

409
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:43,460
kids must have been pretty

410
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,799
young. And it's said that they

411
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:46,200
were a Dutch family living in

412
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,580
the area, right? And as the

413
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,419
story goes around the

414
00:13:49,419 --> 00:13:51,139
Revolutionary War time, so just

415
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:52,679
as stuff is starting to heat up,

416
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:55,799
her parents had property in New

417
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:57,159
Jersey. I don't know why they

418
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:58,399
would want to keep property in

419
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,600
that dirty state. But they

420
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,980
wanted to check up on it and

421
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,419
make sure that the British

422
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:05,200
weren't destroying it or they

423
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,240
were in the area at the time and

424
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,460
they're really worried about it

425
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,460
there. They must have been a

426
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,240
wealthy family to own this

427
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,299
property. It was pretty large.

428
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,019
So what they decided to do, they

429
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,159
decided to leave Annette home

430
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:16,980
alone to watch over the

431
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,360
household and the rest of the

432
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,840
family while they go on a trip

433
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,179
to just check on the property in

434
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:22,659
New Jersey. It was a pretty

435
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:24,600
dangerous trip as again, the

436
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,000
British are kind of in the area.

437
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:27,259
In fact, New York, I think was

438
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:29,000
controlled by the British for a

439
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,759
long time during the

440
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:34,320
Revolutionary War. So it

441
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,279
wouldn't be an easy trip. It'd

442
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,299
be pretty difficult to do. And

443
00:14:37,299 --> 00:14:38,000
there was actually a lot of

444
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,100
loyal loyalist supporters across

445
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,039
Long Island amongst farmers.

446
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,399
Stony Brook had a good mix of

447
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:51,440
pro-American citizens, but not a

448
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,019
good time to travel. And so

449
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:56,519
Annette was extremely distressed

450
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:57,919
by this. She begged them not to

451
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:59,980
leave, but they had to. And so

452
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,240
she was left alone, terrified to

453
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,340
fend for herself and her

454
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,240
siblings, not knowing when her

455
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,159
parents would get back. And of

456
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:07,980
course, she had nothing to

457
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,399
defend herself from the British.

458
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:11,820
She could do nothing. So lo and

459
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,940
behold, when the British came

460
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,460
and seeing a beautiful, huge

461
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:19,980
property demanded that Annette

462
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,240
allowed them to stay there. What

463
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,860
could she do? She had to say

464
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,299
yes, she couldn't do anything

465
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:27,559
and she needed to keep herself

466
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,419
and her siblings safe. So she

467
00:15:29,419 --> 00:15:31,320
let them stay. And so it said

468
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,539
for the period of time where the

469
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:34,720
British troops occupied the

470
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,960
property, Annette spent her days

471
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,980
just totally, totally depressed,

472
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,899
wandering around, sitting in the

473
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:45,620
old field room, which is on the

474
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,379
second floor. Nowadays, it's

475
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,899
like a private party room in the

476
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:50,919
restaurant in the second floor,

477
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,259
sitting out, looking out the

478
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:55,019
window, just blankly staring,

479
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:56,039
waiting for her parents to

480
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,200
return. Every day, this is what

481
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,379
she would do. She'd just wander

482
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:01,419
around, just worried about her

483
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,039
parents, worried about keeping

484
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:04,600
after her siblings, worried

485
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,240
about the British, worried about

486
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,259
the war, and this one for a long

487
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:11,139
time. And unfortunately, her

488
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:13,480
parents never returned. They

489
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,039
were killed by the British in

490
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:17,080
New Jersey. And to make matters

491
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,240
worse, when the British left

492
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,820
finally, the townspeople didn't

493
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,360
take too kindly to her housing

494
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,460
their enemy and they accused her

495
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:31,039
of being a British spy. And an

496
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:33,559
angry mob broke down the doors

497
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,259
and without any sort of trial,

498
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,419
murdered her and the rest of the

499
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:41,860
family and pulled blood. Like

500
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,820
all the other siblings? Yes,

501
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:45,860
yes. So keep in mind the

502
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,720
interesting parts of the story,

503
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:48,580
right? Now, there are

504
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,700
disagreeing records on whether

505
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,480
she was hanged in the old field

506
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,399
room near the fireplace or

507
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,899
murdered outside. But that's the

508
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:02,279
story. She died and ever since

509
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:05,019
then, there have been countless,

510
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,660
countless, countless encounters

511
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:11,660
with her. The owner, Bob, tells

512
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,920
stories of closing up at night,

513
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,940
turning around the corner, and

514
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,359
bumping into a full apparition

515
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,940
of a young woman, blonde hair,

516
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:23,460
blue eyes, very pale, who turns

517
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,259
to look at him, is startled, has

518
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:28,380
a look of fear and surprise, and

519
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,980
just dissipates in front of him.

520
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,140
He's had stuff like his tie

521
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,359
clip, which is a oddly specific

522
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:38,480
thing, disappear and reappear on

523
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,480
the fireplace where she was

524
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,319
supposedly hanged. But then it

525
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:43,259
gets even weirder because

526
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:44,839
there's actually many, many,

527
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:46,519
many encounters that have had

528
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:49,000
many witnesses. He was once

529
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,460
closing out the restaurant with

530
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,559
an old friend who was very much

531
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:55,019
a skeptic and didn't believe in

532
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:56,059
any of this sort of stuff at

533
00:17:56,059 --> 00:17:58,079
all. They're sitting down when

534
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:00,059
supposedly, and this is from the

535
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:02,660
person himself, a chair in the

536
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,079
restaurant is lifted up and

537
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:05,720
thrown at him. Oh, we got some

538
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,720
poltergeist stuff going on. Yes.

539
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,740
And as they turn to look, they

540
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,759
catch a glimpse of a white

541
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:12,480
dress, kind of flapping right

542
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,799
around like a corner as if

543
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,119
someone just escaped the room.

544
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,599
Well, they call a glimpse of

545
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:18,339
her. So there's this seeming

546
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:19,759
like poltergeist kind of

547
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:21,140
trickery stuff going on with the

548
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,140
hiding of the tie pin as well.

549
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,299
But then you said he also just

550
00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:28,200
ran into her basically, and she

551
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,119
dissipated. That doesn't sound

552
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:33,579
as aggressive as the poltergeist

553
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:38,599
stuff. So if that's true, as far

554
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:40,339
as hauntings go, I mean, you

555
00:18:40,339 --> 00:18:41,319
said it's the most haunted

556
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:42,819
place. There could just be

557
00:18:42,819 --> 00:18:46,019
multiple things at work there

558
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:48,380
because it wouldn't make, I

559
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,160
don't feel like it would make

560
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,160
sense for for there to be

561
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,440
poltergeist activity from the

562
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,500
same thing that got startled and

563
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,859
then vanished. That's a, keep

564
00:18:56,859 --> 00:18:57,839
that in mind. That's an

565
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:00,400
interesting point. Well, to add

566
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,259
to that, were any of the

567
00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:05,440
siblings, like her sister, like

568
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,180
could it have been one of the

569
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,539
sisters instead of her or was

570
00:19:10,539 --> 00:19:12,700
the account that it was probably

571
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,920
a net? All the encounters assume

572
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,940
that it's a net. The stories

573
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,519
never give details on how many

574
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:24,059
siblings there were or how young

575
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:25,599
they were and how many guys, how

576
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:26,759
many girls. So it's always

577
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:29,160
assumed to be a net. Basically

578
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,700
anything that happens in the

579
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,259
house is chalked up to a net to

580
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:34,519
a point where it's kind of like

581
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:36,160
advertised for this restaurant

582
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,640
that you'll get to experience

583
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,299
the ghost of a net because

584
00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:43,200
evidently she's very kind to

585
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,720
children. One day when a family

586
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,920
was dining there, evidently with

587
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,619
a young girl, like four or five

588
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:51,859
years old, the little girl would

589
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:53,960
keep getting up and trying to

590
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,720
get into the men's bathroom. And

591
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,940
Bob the owner eventually came

592
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,880
over and was like, hi, can you

593
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,480
please tell your daughter to

594
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,619
stop? We can't, you know, it's

595
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:07,420
causing a scene. Just let her

596
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,920
know she can't do that. And the

597
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,700
parents were really embarrassed

598
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,740
and mom was like, you know,

599
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,940
sweetie, you can't go there.

600
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:14,500
That's not for girls. That's for

601
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,940
guys. Why are you trying to go

602
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,220
there? And the girl said, my

603
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,859
friend, my friend's trying to

604
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:21,799
play hide and seek with me. She

605
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:23,240
wants me to follow her over

606
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,119
there. And they're like, what?

607
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,640
And they asked the kid to

608
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,359
describe the girl or the friend

609
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:30,960
and she's like, that's a young

610
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,660
girl, young lady, blonde hair,

611
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,019
blue eyes. And she gives a

612
00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:37,220
description exactly matching the

613
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,180
story of Annette Williamson.

614
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,279
Right. In that case, it's like a

615
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:41,759
more friendly story, but there

616
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:43,779
are less friendly things really

617
00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:46,599
kind of just eerie. Very often

618
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:50,099
workers would catch glimpses of

619
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:53,900
her when working outside. They'd

620
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,220
see a silhouette of a young

621
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,859
woman in the window, the same

622
00:20:57,859 --> 00:20:59,160
window she was set to sit in

623
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,539
with like a really sad look and

624
00:21:01,539 --> 00:21:03,240
something interesting. It said

625
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,059
that people who notice her in

626
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:08,119
that context are overcome with a

627
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:10,799
sense of sadness. And the owner,

628
00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:11,900
Bob, has claimed that he's even

629
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,180
seen people just start to cry

630
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,799
like out of nowhere, just be

631
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:17,960
affected that much by the, I

632
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,799
don't know, by the atmosphere of

633
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:21,619
her presence that they just

634
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:24,180
start to weep. And the stories

635
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,079
go on from there. I mean, there

636
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:26,859
are stories of the one night in

637
00:21:26,859 --> 00:21:29,680
like August of 1980. It's really

638
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,740
hot out. You know, when

639
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,720
sometimes there's like

640
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,960
lightning, even though there's

641
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,599
no rain and it's really humid

642
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:36,400
out like heat lightning. Yeah,

643
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,559
that's fake, but continue. What

644
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:45,160
do you mean? Oh, it's not. No,

645
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,119
but a lot of people believe that

646
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:50,480
because it's hot out, that there

647
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,900
is lightning caused by the heat,

648
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,420
but it's actually just far away

649
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,480
lightning. That is very

650
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,460
interesting. Okay, so there's

651
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,259
far away lightning. And all the

652
00:22:00,259 --> 00:22:01,819
lights in the house go out and

653
00:22:01,819 --> 00:22:03,039
all the workers go outside and

654
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:03,980
they're like, oh, what's going

655
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,420
on? And they turn and they see,

656
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:07,900
even though all the lights are

657
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,059
out, there's no power in the

658
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:13,059
window of the old field room on

659
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:14,819
the second floor, the lights are

660
00:22:14,819 --> 00:22:16,779
on and it's almost like a candle

661
00:22:16,779 --> 00:22:18,640
light, like a flickering sort of

662
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,240
light. And they watch as the

663
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,240
shape of a young woman, long

664
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,339
hair, just a silhouette, walks

665
00:22:24,339 --> 00:22:26,200
across the window. And all of a

666
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,359
sudden the lights go back on in

667
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:28,480
the house. They rush back in,

668
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,519
you know, they go up there. Of

669
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:31,779
course, there's no one there. A

670
00:22:31,779 --> 00:22:32,859
lot of weird stuff like that. A

671
00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:35,259
lot of full-on apparitions of

672
00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:37,180
this ghost, sights of her

673
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,319
silhouette, sights of her

674
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:41,859
upfront, playful things like,

675
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:43,019
you know, the tie clip

676
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:44,900
disappearing or candles,

677
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,019
relighting themselves, that

678
00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:48,480
chair being thrown across. Yeah,

679
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,180
just playful. Yeah. And they

680
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:53,140
always hear stuff like footsteps

681
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,880
and all sorts of things. In

682
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,359
fact, I saw an account of a

683
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,299
worker who claimed to have

684
00:22:57,299 --> 00:22:59,440
worked there back in the day who

685
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,700
claimed that basically on some

686
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,559
quiet nights after like closing,

687
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:05,220
the workers would just like hang

688
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,299
out at the bar there and have

689
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:08,359
fun just waiting for something

690
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:09,819
to happen. Like this stuff was

691
00:23:09,819 --> 00:23:11,440
that common. They'd hear voices,

692
00:23:11,579 --> 00:23:12,640
they'd hear footsteps, they'd

693
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,039
hear or they'd see silhouettes,

694
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,700
they'd see things move. And the

695
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,720
wine cellar in the basement

696
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,900
supposedly wine bottles

697
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,400
sometimes will just fly off the

698
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,720
walls and wine glasses will

699
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,759
smash in front of people's

700
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:26,359
faces. And it's all checked up

701
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:27,900
to Annette Williamson. That

702
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,259
would happen at my work. The

703
00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:32,980
heck? Do you? Right. Now when

704
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,299
you have to clean it. True.

705
00:23:34,859 --> 00:23:37,099
Yeah. But so yeah, there's just

706
00:23:37,099 --> 00:23:39,839
a lot of stuff here. And one of

707
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:41,099
the craziest claims I've heard

708
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:43,599
is that like when people listen

709
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:44,819
to music in the restaurant at

710
00:23:44,819 --> 00:23:45,779
night, like the owner will have

711
00:23:45,779 --> 00:23:47,559
like a radio on, the ghost of

712
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,119
Annette will mess with the radio

713
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:51,400
because she loves music. And

714
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,700
she'll turn the knobs and

715
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,019
they'll be like, Annette, what

716
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:56,420
are you doing? So evidently she

717
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,579
loves music. She loves kids. She

718
00:23:57,579 --> 00:24:00,019
loves music. All great. Crank up

719
00:24:00,019 --> 00:24:01,500
some AC DC that they put on

720
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,279
after closing. Exactly. She just

721
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,839
jams out to some classic rock.

722
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:06,339
That's kind of interesting that

723
00:24:06,339 --> 00:24:08,200
she's very, you know, attached

724
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,680
to the music kind of thing

725
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,480
because radios weren't really

726
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,500
too common or I don't even think

727
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,420
they were a thing back then.

728
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:18,220
Yeah, it's good. Yeah. So I

729
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,259
don't, I mean, obviously people

730
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:22,799
had music for centuries and

731
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,859
centuries, but it's interesting

732
00:24:24,859 --> 00:24:27,200
to think that new technology is

733
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,259
impacting the old behaviors of

734
00:24:30,259 --> 00:24:33,079
the ghost. Ghosts can learn. You

735
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:33,839
think that means they can use

736
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,240
iPhones as well? They could like

737
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,720
pause your Spotify. No, but they

738
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,980
might be able to type in the

739
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,519
chat GPT if they possess your

740
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:43,140
computer. That is just what chat

741
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:47,319
GPT is. AI are just ghosts.

742
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,240
Yeah, it's just like ghosts. But

743
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,359
great. So we have all these

744
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:54,440
accounts. I mean, you even have

745
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,420
accounts of people, like random

746
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:59,059
people driving by at night and

747
00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:02,400
seeing the silhouette of Annette

748
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,980
Williamson in the window and

749
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,660
being overcome with sadness. So

750
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,660
from a distance. While the yeah,

751
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,000
so while the original story kind

752
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,819
of comes from that French

753
00:25:11,819 --> 00:25:12,980
sidekick that passes to the

754
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,440
owner and then the Carrie Anne

755
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,980
and Joe kind of running with it

756
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,420
and claiming to be in contact

757
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,440
with her when they visit, you

758
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,759
don't have just sightings

759
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:23,660
limited to those people. You

760
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,619
have normal if you look at the

761
00:25:25,619 --> 00:25:27,779
reviews on Google Maps of this

762
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:29,579
place and you search for haunted

763
00:25:29,579 --> 00:25:31,359
or ghost, people will reference

764
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:32,940
her and be like, love the

765
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,559
atmosphere, love the friendly

766
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,720
spirits, love Annette, always

767
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,140
great to visit her. And it's

768
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,079
like, it's weird. So I'd love to

769
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:41,339
go there. I think this summer we

770
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:42,259
should try going there. If you

771
00:25:42,259 --> 00:25:43,940
guys come down, we'll visit it.

772
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:46,660
Yeah. Well, quick question. You

773
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,940
said so like, I'm still hung up

774
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,339
on that throwing the chair. Has

775
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,000
anyone been hurt? Because you

776
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,039
know, you hear stories of people

777
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:54,319
getting scratched or like being

778
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,759
pushed downstairs with like

779
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:58,339
these kind of more also these

780
00:25:58,339 --> 00:26:00,079
poltergeist things. So I'm just

781
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,400
wondering if someone's been hurt

782
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,980
and then like they also just

783
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,599
chalk it up to Annette when I

784
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:06,519
mean, there are reviews saying,

785
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,400
oh, she's great. We love her.

786
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,019
That's a good question. I think

787
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:12,420
not good for business,

788
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,160
obviously. So they might not

789
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,380
really. So yeah, so that's an

790
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,680
interesting point. The business

791
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,400
will always tell like the cute,

792
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:20,599
the cutesy stories about

793
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:23,519
Annette. Paranormal

794
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:24,740
investigators that come to visit

795
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,880
and write books often tell more

796
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,759
of the other stories like EVPs

797
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:30,859
that might have more the ones

798
00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:32,400
I've listened to stuff are just

799
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,920
voices saying, come. So not not

800
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,160
spooky, but the like the

801
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,579
restaurant doesn't advertise the

802
00:26:39,579 --> 00:26:41,220
throwing chair story. Well,

803
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:42,920
yeah, I mean, I was just curious

804
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,539
if any, you know, yeah, no, I

805
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:47,839
don't I haven't heard of any

806
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,779
other violent things besides

807
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:52,119
throwing wine glasses and wine

808
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:53,339
bottles off. That's that's kind

809
00:26:53,339 --> 00:26:56,700
of that's not peaceful. I'm

810
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,240
wondering if it very well could

811
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,099
be Annette in both the peaceful

812
00:27:01,099 --> 00:27:03,119
and, you know, a little bit more

813
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:04,819
violent scenarios. I'm wondering

814
00:27:04,819 --> 00:27:06,579
if she's just reacts to people

815
00:27:06,579 --> 00:27:08,880
differently. Like she may see,

816
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:12,599
you know, a white strong man and

817
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:14,500
think, OK, you're probably one

818
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,140
of the British. I don't really

819
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,700
like you because you got me in

820
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,079
and killed or, you know, maybe

821
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:23,759
one of the townspeople that had

822
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:27,319
her hung or executed, maybe

823
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:28,759
someone looked like that. And

824
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:30,200
that's what caused the reaction.

825
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:32,680
Yeah, she kind of taking taking

826
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,440
her biases to the grave.

827
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:36,880
Discriminatory. Well, we have

828
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,599
all this evidence of Annette

829
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:41,640
Williamson, her tragic story,

830
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,079
her tragic tale, her poor

831
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:44,259
family. Right. You think like

832
00:27:44,259 --> 00:27:46,700
there'd be a lot of spirits at

833
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,839
this place for her whole family.

834
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,160
So all the kids, the parents

835
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,019
killed in New Jersey. There's no

836
00:27:52,019 --> 00:27:53,200
worse way to go out than being

837
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,500
killed in New Jersey by British

838
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:59,380
people. All right. Wow. True.

839
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:04,039
Wait. That's only half of the

840
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:06,940
story because as far as I can

841
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:10,980
tell, Annette Williamson never

842
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,599
existed. Oh, good. She doesn't

843
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:18,039
exist. So is it like a publicity

844
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:21,519
stunt from the restaurant? I

845
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:23,599
don't know. Well, this was a

846
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:25,079
story from the French psychic,

847
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:28,299
right? Let's let's roll back.

848
00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:29,759
Let's go to this guy all the way

849
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:31,599
back. Let's roll all the way

850
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:32,640
back to the history of this

851
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,960
place. So I found the history of

852
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,759
this place back to 1710. All

853
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:39,200
different people. It's passed

854
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,839
down through the entire history

855
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:43,779
of Stony Brook, the families

856
00:28:43,779 --> 00:28:46,160
there, the development of Stony

857
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,759
Brook, the historical figures

858
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:50,480
here. And as I started reading

859
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,680
the story of Annette Williamson,

860
00:28:52,259 --> 00:28:53,819
while also the history of Stony

861
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:54,839
Brook and the house and the

862
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:56,400
ownership, I was like, wait a

863
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,140
minute, this doesn't all this

864
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,119
doesn't make sense. And I found

865
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:00,940
a great blog post that pointed

866
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,980
this out too, and did some

867
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,059
digging and I did some digging

868
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:06,859
based on that. So there are a

869
00:29:06,859 --> 00:29:08,259
bunch of inconsistencies with

870
00:29:08,259 --> 00:29:11,299
the Annette story that we're

871
00:29:11,299 --> 00:29:12,579
going to go into. Wonderful.

872
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,279
Number one, there was never a

873
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,299
Williamson family that owns the

874
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,720
property. That's a pretty big

875
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,740
red flag. You just checked that

876
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,339
with like deed like records.

877
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:30,720
Yeah. So at the time, the Davis

878
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,119
family who originally built the

879
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:36,859
property still owned it. They

880
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:38,500
owned it for like four

881
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,720
generations. So well past the

882
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,039
American Revolution, it was

883
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,220
owned by the Davis family.

884
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:43,519
That's like a hundred years at

885
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:45,059
least. Yeah, right. So there

886
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:46,160
wasn't a Williamson family that

887
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,599
owned it. There was a Williamson

888
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:51,480
family that lived in the area,

889
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:53,700
actually around the corner. I

890
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,900
was just about to ask if they

891
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,160
were like friends or neighbors

892
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,079
or something. They were

893
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:00,420
neighbors, but that was in like

894
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:04,640
the early to mid 1800s, nowhere

895
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:10,180
near 1776. On top of that, the

896
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:14,299
name Annette just wasn't used at

897
00:30:14,299 --> 00:30:16,099
the time. That is not a name

898
00:30:16,099 --> 00:30:18,480
that was used in the colonies

899
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,220
slash America. Well, are there

900
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,400
in the late 1700s? There are

901
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,380
like almost no records of that

902
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,339
name. And there wouldn't be any

903
00:30:27,339 --> 00:30:28,980
like census records going back

904
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,900
that far really. There actually

905
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,140
are. There actually are a lot of

906
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:36,000
death records and that. We're

907
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,059
gonna get into that but not like

908
00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:39,559
US census, you know, because

909
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:40,900
that wasn't a thing. Yeah, there

910
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,000
are records, but yeah, they're

911
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,259
pretty flaky. But I was able to

912
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,500
find the Williamson's that lived

913
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,660
there and died there, which

914
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,519
we'll talk about in a moment.

915
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,740
But on top of that, even before

916
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,640
we get to the damning evidence,

917
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,799
Annette isn't a common name at

918
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:59,059
the time. Williamson isn't a

919
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:01,660
Dutch last name. It's English

920
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:04,859
and Scottish. Okay. So the name

921
00:31:04,859 --> 00:31:06,480
Annette isn't the last name

922
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,740
isn't Dutch. The name wasn't

923
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:11,440
used for like generations later.

924
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,259
The family never owned the

925
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:15,359
property. There was the family

926
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:16,660
that lived in the area

927
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:19,220
generations later. So I'm

928
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,819
wondering, how can this story,

929
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,359
there's so many questions from

930
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:25,059
that. Like people see the ghost

931
00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:26,799
of Annette Williamson. Yeah, or

932
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,140
something. They see her. They

933
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,619
see something that fits the

934
00:31:30,619 --> 00:31:35,859
description of Annette and it's

935
00:31:35,859 --> 00:31:38,299
mostly hanged in. Right? So I

936
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:39,740
descends out that the evidence

937
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,579
that's proposed for this story

938
00:31:42,579 --> 00:31:45,319
is that if you go to the Oba

939
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:47,259
Diah Davis cemetery in the back

940
00:31:47,259 --> 00:31:49,799
of their property, you'll see

941
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:52,259
the Williamson family tombstones

942
00:31:52,259 --> 00:31:53,799
and you'll see in the net,

943
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:58,059
you'll see a John Williamson and

944
00:31:58,059 --> 00:32:00,420
then the net Williamson. Let me

945
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:03,099
send you guys the link here. I

946
00:32:03,099 --> 00:32:07,079
found the tombs and pictures of

947
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:09,700
the tombs. So they do have them.

948
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,500
The people buried here. You just

949
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,759
can't visit there, but there are

950
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:15,279
pictures of the stuff in the

951
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,180
cemetery. It seems like you can

952
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,220
ask to go there. And what's

953
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,619
interesting, the reason we have

954
00:32:19,619 --> 00:32:21,259
these pictures and the dates and

955
00:32:21,259 --> 00:32:23,059
the names is because a

956
00:32:23,059 --> 00:32:27,819
descendant of Oba Diah Davis

957
00:32:27,819 --> 00:32:30,779
living today went there and

958
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:32,599
documented it all on this

959
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:34,900
website, find a grave and

960
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,440
documented all his ancestors and

961
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,619
the other people who lived here.

962
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,720
Have you guys scroll through

963
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,599
this list, which I'll have in

964
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:42,220
the show notes. Do you guys see

965
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,700
Annette Williamson? I see a

966
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,200
Hannah, a John, and a William

967
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,099
Williamson, real creative guys.

968
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:50,799
And when did they die? The mid

969
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,940
1800s. Yep. We've got 1827 for

970
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:58,380
Hannah, 1844 for John, 1831 for

971
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,619
William. It just doesn't line

972
00:33:00,619 --> 00:33:02,059
up. There's no Annette

973
00:33:02,059 --> 00:33:04,880
Williamson. There weren't

974
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,299
Williamson's that died in this

975
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:08,400
area or on that property that

976
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:12,119
time. Now, let me play devil's

977
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:13,920
advocate for a quick second and

978
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,900
give some highly unplausible

979
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,660
explanation. Yeah, of course.

980
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,000
But it could be very well that

981
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,059
there may have been an Annette

982
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:26,180
Williamson, but there could have

983
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:29,380
been something that happened,

984
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,059
like some kind of illegitimate

985
00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:33,539
marriage or birth or something

986
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:34,799
with her involved. And of

987
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,579
course, back then, you know,

988
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,019
women didn't really have a lot

989
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:40,380
going for them. So if there was

990
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,779
a situation like that, you know,

991
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:44,720
she would probably get in the

992
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,019
most, you know, trouble if

993
00:33:47,019 --> 00:33:48,079
anything like that happened

994
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:50,819
rather than the man. So it could

995
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:51,900
have just been like something

996
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,640
happened. They didn't want that,

997
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,380
you know, quote stain on their

998
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,880
family. And maybe it's she could

999
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,500
have just been buried in some

1000
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,779
unmarked grave. That's I know,

1001
00:34:03,859 --> 00:34:05,859
again, far fetched. But like,

1002
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,320
well, see my she was that my

1003
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,139
issue with that is there are

1004
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:14,400
Williamson tombstones there like

1005
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,159
Frank has shown us. Right. And

1006
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:19,219
they're well past the date of

1007
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:20,960
the American Revolution, which

1008
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,840
doesn't add up with the story of

1009
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,699
them all dying. Like supposedly

1010
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:28,260
the the way that Frank has told

1011
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,960
the first half of the story is

1012
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,360
that the bloodline of the

1013
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,780
Williamson, at least in that

1014
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,500
area, died out that night. Yeah.

1015
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,880
I mean, the only thing I could

1016
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,980
say to that would be like, maybe

1017
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,119
the psychic got it wrong and it

1018
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,179
was the Civil War and some

1019
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:49,019
Southerners or some Southern

1020
00:34:49,019 --> 00:34:51,639
sympathizers killed them. That's

1021
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:53,400
that's actually again, this is

1022
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,639
that's just solely yeah, she did

1023
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,260
exist and just trying to come up

1024
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,480
with something about maybe why

1025
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,900
she's not there. Very unlikely

1026
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,599
that any of this I never thought

1027
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:07,519
of the ballot. Yeah, I mean,

1028
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:09,440
even the civil like, because

1029
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,980
yeah, that but even then that's

1030
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,940
still before the great the

1031
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,159
deaths of the people that still

1032
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:17,440
before so like, again, just to

1033
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,780
think of something about maybe

1034
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,639
why she could be, you know, a

1035
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:24,139
real person. Yeah. That's that's

1036
00:35:24,139 --> 00:35:25,260
an important thing to know. It

1037
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,199
definitely is possible that

1038
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:28,539
there was an Annette Williamson

1039
00:35:28,539 --> 00:35:31,780
who lived maybe, right, maybe

1040
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,099
they didn't own the property,

1041
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:36,340
maybe, maybe parts of the story

1042
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,119
are true, right? Yeah. And yes,

1043
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:39,860
maybe we just don't have the

1044
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,900
records of it and it doesn't

1045
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,199
line up. Maybe there is a spirit

1046
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:43,920
of her whatever reason still

1047
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,059
there. However, given what

1048
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:51,340
evidence does exist, when you

1049
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,699
look into it, there actually is

1050
00:35:53,699 --> 00:35:57,719
no physical evidence to support

1051
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:01,320
the story. At all. Everything

1052
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,699
unfortunately came from that one

1053
00:36:02,699 --> 00:36:04,860
original psychic, as far as I

1054
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,420
can tell, and the follow up

1055
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,780
psychics and mediums that claim

1056
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,619
to be in contact. Do we have the

1057
00:36:09,619 --> 00:36:11,440
name of the original French

1058
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,119
psychic or I could not find it

1059
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:16,440
now. If I can find it, I'll put

1060
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,699
in the show. The asking. Do you

1061
00:36:20,699 --> 00:36:21,559
remember what that guy's name

1062
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:25,679
was? I am actually debating

1063
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:29,239
calling up the restaurant or

1064
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:31,380
sending an email and not being,

1065
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,360
you know, critical and saying,

1066
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:35,019
the story you tell us. No, of

1067
00:36:35,019 --> 00:36:38,480
course. He doesn't. What is true

1068
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,300
is that people see something,

1069
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:41,699
right? They experience

1070
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,760
something. They see a ghost of a

1071
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,559
young woman. They see stuff fly

1072
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:47,780
off shelves. They get chairs,

1073
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,639
chairs, they get candles, relit.

1074
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:50,719
They see things. They hear

1075
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:52,440
things. They experience things.

1076
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,699
That's I don't doubt. Right. Me

1077
00:36:55,699 --> 00:36:57,159
neither. Then what's going on?

1078
00:36:57,539 --> 00:37:00,000
We have an unidentified spookum.

1079
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,840
What is going on? Isn't that I

1080
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,000
feel like that's even more

1081
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,960
interesting than it being true.

1082
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,679
Personally, I think story of an

1083
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:07,820
interesting things. They just

1084
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,880
don't make sense. Why would the

1085
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,480
whole, like the British soldiers

1086
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,719
just murdered a bunch of babies,

1087
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,719
like a bunch of kids. They're

1088
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:14,079
not monsters. Why did the

1089
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,719
parents die? But the historical

1090
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:17,960
record clear. I mean, I found

1091
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,579
documents from Stony Brook going

1092
00:37:19,579 --> 00:37:21,380
back to like that were published

1093
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,920
in like 1907, showing pictures

1094
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,059
and giving the history. And

1095
00:37:25,059 --> 00:37:26,599
there's never ever any

1096
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:30,320
historical record, any mention

1097
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,000
of a Williamson family owning

1098
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,760
it. It's always Obadiah Davis

1099
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,739
for generations and Thomas

1100
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:39,019
Hadaway for many years. Then

1101
00:37:39,019 --> 00:37:40,059
what's going on? Right.

1102
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,559
Unfortunately, I think some

1103
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:44,199
people are being a little

1104
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:45,780
untruthful for maybe different

1105
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,159
reasons. That is the psychics

1106
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:50,400
claim that if you go to the

1107
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,639
cemetery, you will see her

1108
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:54,719
tombstone. That's just not true.

1109
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,739
The two psychics, I forget their

1110
00:37:58,739 --> 00:38:01,099
name. Yeah. I watched an hour

1111
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:02,300
and a half long presentation by

1112
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:06,019
them and I feel like I'm I'll

1113
00:38:06,019 --> 00:38:07,340
link to in the show notes. I

1114
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,860
hope no one, I hope this doesn't

1115
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:11,239
get back to them. But they talk

1116
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:12,679
about, I mean, I went through

1117
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:14,639
that video and I found just, I

1118
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:15,579
kept track of all the things

1119
00:38:15,579 --> 00:38:16,960
that were, that appeared to be

1120
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,059
factually incorrect with what

1121
00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:20,059
they were saying. They had a

1122
00:38:20,059 --> 00:38:21,559
little slideshow. They claimed

1123
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:22,940
that there's only two tombstones

1124
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,699
of Williamson's at the cemetery.

1125
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,300
And one of them is Annette. The

1126
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,719
other one is John. That's not

1127
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:30,119
true. There's three. And there's

1128
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:32,739
no Annette. Maybe, I don't know,

1129
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,519
how do you get Annette from like

1130
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:36,579
Hannah or John or Willy? Is

1131
00:38:36,579 --> 00:38:40,440
there any weird, like old, old,

1132
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,539
like translation or something of

1133
00:38:43,539 --> 00:38:45,860
like Annette to Hannah in any

1134
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,059
way? Not that I even see. I

1135
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:49,820
don't think so. Yeah. Doesn't

1136
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:52,059
sound very likely. But the only

1137
00:38:52,059 --> 00:39:01,019
thing some related to that is of

1138
00:39:01,019 --> 00:39:03,719
the Dutch last name. So like

1139
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:05,639
they could maybe they're, you

1140
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:06,980
know, because I point out it's

1141
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,639
not even the Dutch name. It

1142
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:09,480
could, you know, it could have

1143
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,360
been a Dutch name that was

1144
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,719
turned into a more English name.

1145
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,219
Perhaps. In the colonies. But

1146
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:16,320
yeah, just really, it doesn't

1147
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,619
line up. But it makes me wonder

1148
00:39:17,619 --> 00:39:20,179
because you've got EVPs of the

1149
00:39:20,179 --> 00:39:22,679
voices. You've got, you've got

1150
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:23,739
psychics claiming to be in

1151
00:39:23,739 --> 00:39:25,599
contact with her, claiming to

1152
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,800
see her, claiming to have her

1153
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,239
tell them the story. Right. The

1154
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:31,320
original psychic claimed

1155
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,300
Annette, Annette spirit told him

1156
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,619
her terribly sad story. So

1157
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:39,940
what's going on? Right. Is it? I

1158
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:40,780
don't think everyone's just

1159
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,800
pretending. I don't think it's

1160
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,940
hallucinations. No, I never

1161
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,280
liked that explanation either.

1162
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:48,079
The hallucinations. Is it the

1163
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:52,480
story has generated the

1164
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,159
experiences that people see? Is

1165
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:56,800
that possible? Is it that the

1166
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,199
story of a young 17 year old

1167
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:00,679
Annette Williamson with long

1168
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:01,880
blonde hair, blue eyes that

1169
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,320
haunts because of this story.

1170
00:40:03,739 --> 00:40:06,599
Did that generate a ghost that

1171
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:08,219
people now see? What do you guys

1172
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:09,960
think? I have two things when

1173
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,980
they do the EVP or when the, I

1174
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,280
guess when the, you know, you

1175
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,340
can't really know what the

1176
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,920
psychics are hearing from the

1177
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,099
spirits or whatever, I guess.

1178
00:40:18,739 --> 00:40:20,920
But when they say like, Oh, do

1179
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,280
they say, Oh, Annette, are you

1180
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,440
here? Like, do they specifically

1181
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,440
say, okay. Because I'm gonna say

1182
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,980
if they just say nothing related

1183
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,780
to her name. Yep. No, it's, it

1184
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,619
is the address Annette. They

1185
00:40:33,619 --> 00:40:35,340
mentioned the story. I even

1186
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,579
watched a YouTube video of some

1187
00:40:36,579 --> 00:40:40,519
kid from six years ago who would

1188
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:41,639
go around long on with his

1189
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,780
grandma who was psychic and he

1190
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,880
would bring an EVP meter and go

1191
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,039
into haunted places and go in

1192
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:49,159
this place. He'd go, Annette,

1193
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,019
are you there? His voice is kind

1194
00:40:52,019 --> 00:40:53,119
of funny. I feel bad for

1195
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,019
laughing at him, but it's very

1196
00:40:54,019 --> 00:40:55,340
funny. I'll put it in the show

1197
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,800
notes. Annette, are you there?

1198
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:00,119
And then you hear like the thing

1199
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:01,059
go off and he's grandma,

1200
00:41:01,219 --> 00:41:02,679
grandma, grandma, come here.

1201
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:06,199
It's really weird. Grandma and

1202
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:08,079
grandson, paranormal

1203
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,539
investigating duo. And his dad

1204
00:41:10,539 --> 00:41:12,639
and his uncle are part of their

1205
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:14,300
production. It's pretty cool.

1206
00:41:15,019 --> 00:41:16,340
It's a family business, but it

1207
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,400
is the guy's voice is funny.

1208
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:20,780
What do you think? So one thing

1209
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,380
that I was considering, which

1210
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,159
still doesn't completely make

1211
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:26,619
the story lineup, perhaps

1212
00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:29,780
because the entire family was

1213
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,599
killed and, you know, there was

1214
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:34,619
no like next of kin to bury

1215
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:36,519
them. Perhaps the British

1216
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:38,239
soldiers just took them and

1217
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:40,099
dumped them with other bodies or

1218
00:41:40,099 --> 00:41:41,960
oh wait, no, it was the

1219
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,400
townspeople that killed them.

1220
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,500
Wasn't it? But maybe that works

1221
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,539
though. Cause yeah, the story is

1222
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:49,320
that they were so pissed at the

1223
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,280
Williamson's that they killed

1224
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,099
them all. So maybe, yeah, maybe

1225
00:41:51,099 --> 00:41:51,900
they wouldn't give them a proper

1226
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,599
burial. Yeah. So, you know,

1227
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,300
maybe they, their bodies and

1228
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,900
therefore records have gone

1229
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,460
unnoticed. What about the other

1230
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,659
tombs though, that are

1231
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:02,059
Williamson's? Is that just like

1232
00:42:02,059 --> 00:42:04,119
a later branch of that family? I

1233
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:06,219
mean, it's, it's not like an

1234
00:42:06,219 --> 00:42:08,320
unheard of name. That's, yeah.

1235
00:42:08,619 --> 00:42:10,340
You know, and given that their

1236
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:13,079
names are what would be John and

1237
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,840
Hannah and William and William.

1238
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,239
William Williamson. Well, you

1239
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:21,380
got to start the last name

1240
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:25,400
somewhere, but those all sound a

1241
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,179
lot more English names. So

1242
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:29,960
perhaps it's just a coincidence

1243
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,599
and there's a different family

1244
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,599
of Williamson's. That'd be

1245
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,960
interesting, but they're also in

1246
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,900
the same exact area at the same

1247
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,760
time. It's unlikely, but yeah,

1248
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:40,260
it's definitely possible. I

1249
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,960
never, honestly, thinking about

1250
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,119
like maybe the time period is

1251
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:45,280
off or that those were two

1252
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,500
theories that just never crossed

1253
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,619
my mind when doing all this

1254
00:42:47,619 --> 00:42:49,739
research. I was like, this is

1255
00:42:49,739 --> 00:42:51,519
ridiculous. There's no such

1256
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:54,860
person. It's, it's a lie. But

1257
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,820
no, there definitely are, who

1258
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,179
knows, right? I think there's

1259
00:42:59,179 --> 00:43:03,000
something or some things that

1260
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,960
haunt the country house

1261
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,639
restaurant in Stony Brook, New

1262
00:43:07,639 --> 00:43:16,400
York. I don't know what the

1263
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:29,280
mindset in Stony Brook is

1264
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,219
looking for, but it doesn't like

1265
00:43:31,219 --> 00:43:31,920
how it's King and how long has

1266
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,820
it gone apart. And so that's

1267
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:37,840
Liam Simon thanks for joining on

1268
00:43:37,840 --> 00:44:11,480
this episode The PHONE KID It's

1269
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,880
popular enough in Long Island

1270
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,139
and enough people believe it and

1271
00:44:17,139 --> 00:44:19,099
give a lot of credence to it and

1272
00:44:19,099 --> 00:44:20,199
think about it while they're

1273
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:23,920
there. Those thoughts being so

1274
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,739
concentrated on that could

1275
00:44:25,739 --> 00:44:30,000
create like a topic entity and

1276
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,920
it's manifesting as this Annette

1277
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,800
Williamson that really isn't

1278
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,079
there. And that lines up with

1279
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:39,599
there not being any records or

1280
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,920
anything like that. Then where

1281
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,239
do you think the original story

1282
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:46,280
do you think that French psychic

1283
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,079
was just like yeah I want a free

1284
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,460
meal let me just there's a

1285
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:53,639
spirit here. Annette Williamson

1286
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:54,920
let me let me tell you the tale

1287
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,820
over a dinner. You think you

1288
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,500
just made up a story and Annette

1289
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,619
we don't know anything about

1290
00:44:59,619 --> 00:45:00,880
that. We don't know anything

1291
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,280
about the French psych. Yeah I

1292
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,280
got to find we got to find that

1293
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,099
guy. Yeah or we got to find

1294
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:08,079
Annette. Yeah. Oh I would love

1295
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:09,659
to go and evidently people just

1296
00:45:09,659 --> 00:45:11,239
show up or talk to the guy and

1297
00:45:11,239 --> 00:45:12,400
he lets them like do paranormal

1298
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,719
investigations like the owner is

1299
00:45:13,719 --> 00:45:15,380
very obviously it's like a great

1300
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,659
marketing thing right. He's

1301
00:45:16,659 --> 00:45:18,539
really into it. Also he really

1302
00:45:18,539 --> 00:45:20,280
people are people are

1303
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,820
experiencing things like we've

1304
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,260
been saying something's

1305
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:24,840
happening. Oh yeah there is it

1306
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,719
there's stuff there. It's if

1307
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:28,639
it's a Topa that's people have

1308
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:29,780
thought because people thought

1309
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:30,940
it's Annette and that's what's

1310
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:37,119
happening then sure but if it's

1311
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:38,840
not and there's something else

1312
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,480
at play maybe again there could

1313
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,159
be there are plenty of

1314
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:44,440
undocumented deaths that happen

1315
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,900
and I'm sure back then it was

1316
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,960
probably more common. Not saying

1317
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,460
no records were taken. It wasn't

1318
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:53,820
that long ago but could be an

1319
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:55,739
undocumented death and it's just

1320
00:45:55,739 --> 00:45:58,539
matching the same description.

1321
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:00,059
The Annette thing could have

1322
00:46:00,059 --> 00:46:02,699
just been made up. Who knows

1323
00:46:02,699 --> 00:46:06,860
like the actual name like it

1324
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,460
could be like a person could

1325
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,159
still have died there but maybe

1326
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:12,780
her name wasn't Annette. That's

1327
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,820
true. Well final thoughts Aaron.

1328
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,579
When are we going down to this

1329
00:46:16,579 --> 00:46:18,380
restaurant. It's my final

1330
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:21,059
thoughts. Give me let's let's

1331
00:46:21,059 --> 00:46:23,940
say a few months. I will go I

1332
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:26,860
will call I'll say Bob. Bob you

1333
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:30,059
lying to me. Let me see. Show me

1334
00:46:30,059 --> 00:46:32,139
the grave Bob. Show me Annette

1335
00:46:32,139 --> 00:46:34,960
Williamson. It's in your

1336
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,219
backyard. You know I would love

1337
00:46:38,219 --> 00:46:39,380
to get to buy on that. It's also

1338
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,679
weird that there's kind of aside

1339
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:43,860
from the story that this is

1340
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,599
what's called Long Island's you

1341
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:47,860
know quote most haunted location

1342
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:50,440
when there's all those stories

1343
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,840
and conspiracy theories of what

1344
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:55,500
happened out on like Montauk.

1345
00:46:55,739 --> 00:46:57,619
That's like why those are gonna

1346
00:46:57,619 --> 00:46:58,679
be great stories for another

1347
00:46:58,679 --> 00:47:00,599
time. Like why like when I think

1348
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:03,440
of like you know spooky things

1349
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,900
or just weird things in Long

1350
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,340
Island I think of Montauk. I

1351
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:09,920
don't think of this restaurant

1352
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,900
in Stony Brook. We'll have to

1353
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,480
record another episode on that.

1354
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,420
Yeah you're right I think maybe

1355
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:19,099
this is um it's very accessible.

1356
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:21,360
I guess. Yeah it's like right

1357
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,500
you can tell us the kids you

1358
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,840
tell it to uh to adults. It's

1359
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,179
yeah it's like something that

1360
00:47:26,179 --> 00:47:27,320
right we're not saying like

1361
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,380
Bigfoot lives in shore on the

1362
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:32,059
New York. He might you don't

1363
00:47:32,059 --> 00:47:34,219
know. Oh he might. There's not

1364
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:35,400
enough people in the summer

1365
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,579
home. In those artificial woods

1366
00:47:38,579 --> 00:47:40,039
down on Long Island. Bigfoot in

1367
00:47:40,039 --> 00:47:42,400
the Hamptons. That sounds like a

1368
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,699
movie or a book or something.

1369
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:50,940
Sounds like yeah I think maybe

1370
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:52,880
that's you know it's easy to

1371
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,219
market. It's like a great

1372
00:47:54,219 --> 00:47:57,800
touristy thing too. But yeah

1373
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,440
something's going on there. I

1374
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,539
think it'd be great if we had a

1375
00:48:01,539 --> 00:48:03,440
nice dinner there and uh kept an

1376
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,699
eye out for her. And Annette

1377
00:48:04,699 --> 00:48:06,619
threw a knife at you. Okay

1378
00:48:06,619 --> 00:48:09,500
butter knife. Maybe just like

1379
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:11,019
change the channel on the radio.

1380
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:12,219
That's good. Change the channel.

1381
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,780
The craziest claim I heard from

1382
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:17,260
Joe the media psychic or

1383
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:19,760
whatever was that he has EVPs

1384
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,739
where you hear the background

1385
00:48:21,739 --> 00:48:23,159
music of the restaurant playing.

1386
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,980
And it will cut from that to the

1387
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,699
voice of a young woman singing.

1388
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:31,960
Just no music at all just her

1389
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,440
singing. I don't know what he

1390
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,860
meant. Oh good. I never one

1391
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:38,019
thing couldn't find recordings.

1392
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,380
Like a personal thing for me

1393
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:43,099
EVPs always are so shaky for me.

1394
00:48:43,699 --> 00:48:45,659
Like all the audio evidence that

1395
00:48:45,659 --> 00:48:46,980
like you know plenty of the

1396
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:49,639
ghost shows do and like even on

1397
00:48:49,639 --> 00:48:51,300
like I love like the BuzzFeed

1398
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,179
unsolved guys what they what

1399
00:48:53,179 --> 00:48:54,480
they did. Yeah like but they

1400
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,039
still do like the EVP things. I

1401
00:48:56,039 --> 00:48:57,800
never really liked that you know

1402
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,079
and I you know I believe in

1403
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,380
ghosts and that a lot of people

1404
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:02,300
experience a lot of weird

1405
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:03,900
things. I have friends that have

1406
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,119
experienced things but like

1407
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:06,880
those audio recording things I

1408
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,300
don't put a lot of a lot of

1409
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:09,880
credence into what those give.

1410
00:49:10,199 --> 00:49:12,260
So I'm always hesitant when

1411
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:13,559
someone says oh look at the CVP

1412
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:15,019
because even like you said it

1413
00:49:15,019 --> 00:49:17,880
said oh come. Ah yes one. Yeah

1414
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,699
those are the ones that are

1415
00:49:18,699 --> 00:49:20,159
those that's just such the

1416
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:21,679
classic EVP. I'll put them in

1417
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:23,239
the astronauts. Where you get

1418
00:49:23,239 --> 00:49:27,360
one word. It may be two. You

1419
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:30,079
never get full sentences but the

1420
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:31,440
full sentences you get might

1421
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,000
come from like psychics but then

1422
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,280
now you have to put all your

1423
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,179
belief in this one person and

1424
00:49:37,179 --> 00:49:39,219
apparently at least with these

1425
00:49:39,219 --> 00:49:40,599
psychics they just missed the

1426
00:49:40,599 --> 00:49:41,699
mark. Yeah that makes you wonder

1427
00:49:41,699 --> 00:49:43,219
like are they just picking up on

1428
00:49:43,219 --> 00:49:45,099
that like you said Nick like

1429
00:49:45,099 --> 00:49:46,719
that thought form that's out

1430
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:49,940
there like are they just picking

1431
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:52,360
up on what's around. It's not

1432
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,900
necessarily weird. True. Like if

1433
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:57,500
you like okay so say like that

1434
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,739
you know they can contact the

1435
00:49:59,739 --> 00:50:01,699
dead like psychics or mediums.

1436
00:50:01,699 --> 00:50:03,039
It'd be weird for them to be

1437
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:04,300
able to be in contact with

1438
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:07,820
something that's not dead. It's

1439
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:09,659
you know it's a it's a if it is

1440
00:50:09,659 --> 00:50:11,219
like a tulp idea that's just

1441
00:50:11,219 --> 00:50:13,719
like energy from people's

1442
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:15,739
thoughts. You think so? I think

1443
00:50:15,739 --> 00:50:17,960
I mean unless it I mean you can

1444
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,099
go into all this kind of

1445
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,659
different how you know energies

1446
00:50:20,659 --> 00:50:24,340
work and. Aaron should tell us

1447
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:26,159
as the electrical engineer how

1448
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:28,300
energy works. How energy works.

1449
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:30,840
You want to lose viewers with

1450
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:34,559
that one? Which is like it'd be

1451
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:36,139
it's weird to think that like me

1452
00:50:36,139 --> 00:50:37,360
like people that say they're

1453
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,639
mediums that's the connotation

1454
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:40,300
that they talk to the dead. If

1455
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,059
it's a tulpa that's not a dead

1456
00:50:42,059 --> 00:50:43,980
thing. It's the idea of a dead

1457
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,639
thing. That's it. I guess not

1458
00:50:45,639 --> 00:50:47,420
the person but. I understand

1459
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:48,079
what you're saying. So you're

1460
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:50,340
saying if mediums can do what

1461
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:51,800
they claim they would really

1462
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,059
only be communicating with dead

1463
00:50:53,059 --> 00:50:55,320
spirits not with other you know

1464
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,300
quote made up spirits because

1465
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,000
it's again there's a lot of

1466
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,900
energy that goes into like this

1467
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,659
creation of a tulpa like you

1468
00:51:03,659 --> 00:51:05,099
know the Tibetan monks where

1469
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:06,840
this started you know monks you

1470
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,079
know they live a very solitary

1471
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:10,460
life but they can be very

1472
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:13,300
focused. So they put a lot of

1473
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:16,260
thought into whatever entity

1474
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:17,500
they want to create and then

1475
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,380
they create that tulpa. So like

1476
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:20,760
like I said if a lot of people

1477
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,260
are doing that maybe not a lot

1478
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:23,280
of thought but if a lot of

1479
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,260
people are putting some thought

1480
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,739
into it it's still just this

1481
00:51:25,739 --> 00:51:29,199
build up of you know thought

1482
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:31,900
energy. It's it's the equivalent

1483
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:35,559
of a spiritual think tank but

1484
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:36,820
just instead of. Did you have

1485
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:39,719
that written down? No I did not.

1486
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,619
It was like you know a lot of

1487
00:51:41,619 --> 00:51:42,820
people are just thinking about

1488
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:44,900
it. It'd be weird that psychics

1489
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:48,039
could pick up on like thought

1490
00:51:48,039 --> 00:51:50,420
forms rather than spirits

1491
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:51,619
because then that makes you

1492
00:51:51,619 --> 00:51:53,780
wonder for all these like

1493
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:55,440
classic haunted places even down

1494
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,760
there like Amityville and all

1495
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,679
that the psychics that go there

1496
00:51:58,679 --> 00:52:00,119
are they picking up on spirits

1497
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:04,139
or on tulpas if because if a lot

1498
00:52:04,139 --> 00:52:05,059
of people are thinking about

1499
00:52:05,059 --> 00:52:06,340
things and you believe in that

1500
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:08,519
idea of a tulpa it's not

1501
00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:09,820
entirely out of the realm of

1502
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:11,099
possibility that that's what it

1503
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:12,300
is and there aren't actually

1504
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:15,119
any. That's interesting. Yeah I

1505
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:18,059
they came they both came across

1506
00:52:18,059 --> 00:52:20,659
as very sincere and very

1507
00:52:20,659 --> 00:52:22,300
confident but some of the things

1508
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:23,320
that they said were just

1509
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,699
factually wrong so it makes you

1510
00:52:25,699 --> 00:52:27,360
wonder right it really makes you

1511
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,480
wonder I think that there's

1512
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,559
still enough questions that are

1513
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:32,719
left unanswered here. I'm gonna

1514
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:34,519
keep digging a little bit and

1515
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:36,179
maybe we'll report back one day

1516
00:52:36,179 --> 00:52:37,099
but I think it would be great to

1517
00:52:37,099 --> 00:52:42,860
visit see if we expensive meal

1518
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,639
hopefully it'd be good. Maybe if

1519
00:52:45,639 --> 00:52:47,119
we're nice we could visit the

1520
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:49,780
cemetery if we say if we

1521
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:51,139
impersonate FBI agents as Nick

1522
00:52:51,139 --> 00:52:52,880
says. I'm telling you it's a

1523
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,000
surefire way for illegal

1524
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,420
purposes that's a joke. Yeah yes

1525
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:04,059
wink. That's the story of

1526
00:53:04,059 --> 00:53:07,199
Annette Williamson and I have to

1527
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:09,960
say it made me wonder that the

1528
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,039
very first story I decided to

1529
00:53:12,039 --> 00:53:14,559
research and tell was such a

1530
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,380
well-known story in Long Island

1531
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:22,019
that also proved to be on very

1532
00:53:22,019 --> 00:53:25,579
shaky historical ground. Really

1533
00:53:25,579 --> 00:53:27,739
makes you think. So I'm very

1534
00:53:27,739 --> 00:53:29,719
curious to see in the things I

1535
00:53:29,719 --> 00:53:30,679
research next I'm gonna be

1536
00:53:30,679 --> 00:53:31,639
looking more at things in the

1537
00:53:31,639 --> 00:53:33,559
Bronx in my hometown and also

1538
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:34,280
Long Island stuff because

1539
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,260
there's just a lot of history

1540
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:36,739
there. Is that going to be a

1541
00:53:36,739 --> 00:53:37,960
common theme or is this an

1542
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:42,659
outlier? So tune in to the next

1543
00:53:42,659 --> 00:53:44,380
episodes looking forward to what

1544
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:45,460
you guys have in store.

1545
00:53:45,699 --> 00:53:47,480
Hopefully there's less deception

1546
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,860
by psychics and mediums. And

1547
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:52,039
what I have coming up from what

1548
00:53:52,039 --> 00:53:53,780
I've done there are no psychics

1549
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:55,820
involved. It's more the

1550
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:59,340
retelling of others accounts of

1551
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:03,280
a very large cemetery right in

1552
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,320
Schenectady here in the capital

1553
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:09,000
region. Oh we can go there too.

1554
00:54:09,539 --> 00:54:12,179
Yes and you can visit there it's

1555
00:54:12,179 --> 00:54:14,039
a very and you can walk through

1556
00:54:14,039 --> 00:54:16,280
there even at night it is just

1557
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,539
like public and you know people

1558
00:54:18,539 --> 00:54:19,920
have taken it for like shortcuts

1559
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,860
and things but there are a lot

1560
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:24,360
of a lot of like individual

1561
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,320
accounts of things happening

1562
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,840
there and a lot of that's much

1563
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,840
more on the negative side of

1564
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:34,820
things and kind of the the

1565
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:36,260
playfulness that this and that

1566
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:38,559
has exhibited. Awesome. That's

1567
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:39,719
what we'll be looking at from

1568
00:54:39,719 --> 00:54:42,699
me. Yeah from my upcoming story

1569
00:54:42,699 --> 00:54:45,960
we're gonna be real local to us.

1570
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,019
We're gonna be looking at RPI

1571
00:54:48,019 --> 00:54:50,300
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute

1572
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:54,119
where there's legend of a nurse

1573
00:54:54,119 --> 00:55:03,639
Betsy haunting one of the

1574
00:55:03,639 --> 00:55:05,960
women's bad but no one really

1575
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:09,219
knows all that much about it but

1576
00:55:09,219 --> 00:55:10,679
there's been some paranormal

1577
00:55:10,679 --> 00:55:13,659
investigators that came full up.

1578
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:14,739
I'm looking forward to that.

1579
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,059
That's gonna be great. That's

1580
00:55:16,059 --> 00:55:17,760
gonna be spooky. So yeah great

1581
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,179
looking forward to next episodes

1582
00:55:19,179 --> 00:55:20,440
and I hope everyone enjoyed

1583
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:21,820
hearing about Annette

1584
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:23,539
Williamson. I encourage you to

1585
00:55:23,539 --> 00:55:24,940
go go over there and try to talk

1586
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:26,739
to her and ask her what she

1587
00:55:26,739 --> 00:55:29,079
thinks about this. Maybe play

1588
00:55:29,079 --> 00:55:30,260
this on play this episode on the

1589
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:31,679
radio for her there and see if

1590
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:37,119
she changes the channel. That's

1591
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:39,139
