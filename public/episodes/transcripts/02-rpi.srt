00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,580
Initially, the transcribed

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,639
method reads the entire file and

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:06,019
processes the audio with the

4
00:00:06,019 --> 00:00:07,620
sliding 30 second window,

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,080
performing autoregressive

6
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,500
sequence-to-sequence predictions

7
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,820
on each window. Pretty

8
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:18,579
interesting. I am curious as to

9
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:20,320
how accurate the timestamps are

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,440
down to the second.
